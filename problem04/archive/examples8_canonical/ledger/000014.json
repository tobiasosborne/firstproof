The corrections alpha_i = sum_j m_j^p/(lambda_i - p_j^p)^3 and beta_i = sum_j m_j^q/(lambda_i - p_j^q)^3 arise from Herglotz representations omega_p(z) = z + c_p + sum_j m_j^p/(z - p_j^p). The constraint omega_p + omega_q = 2z + ... (from G_r = G_p(omega_p) = G_q(omega_q) and the additive structure of boxplus) couples alpha and beta. This coupling, combined with the Cauchy matrix structure of the corrections, should force J_p*J_q \u003e= ||h||^4. APPROACH: Express J_p, J_q as quadratic forms in the Herglotz residues {m_j^p}, {m_j^q} and show the product satisfies the bound via Schur complement or matrix AM-GM.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"acd2a687a6b42792a092b0dd1b2de1575f4e11a5e9cf75c211715a8c5f0c4b3a","created":"2026-02-08T18:16:43.340415117Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
