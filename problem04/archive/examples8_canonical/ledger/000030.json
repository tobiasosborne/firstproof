The Cauchy matrix structure ensures the quadratic forms have sufficient rank, and the coupling constraint prevents degenerate configurations where J_p*J_q could be small while norm(h) is large.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"5a5d967415427094dc2c6accbc086d22d10ca3b731924c370cba795ba30ff522","created":"2026-02-08T18:17:13.305529297Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
