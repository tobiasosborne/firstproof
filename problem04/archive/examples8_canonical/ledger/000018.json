Equivalently, Phi_n * Phi_n'' \u003e= 2*(Phi_n')^2 where primes denote d/dt. Compute Phi_n' and Phi_n'' via root dynamics. The root positions satisfy dr_i/dt = H(r_i) and d^2r_i/dt^2 can be computed from the interaction terms. Use the identity Phi_n = 2*Sm2 to express derivatives of Phi_n in terms of power sums of 1/(r_i-r_j). The concavity should follow from a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on these power sums. Numerically validated: 0 violations in 590 trials (ex7).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"e26e7d32c85c9a3bc4c1e285e988a2a133b6a847e6a294fbb2025e935ebe6a28","created":"2026-02-08T18:16:45.410334978Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
