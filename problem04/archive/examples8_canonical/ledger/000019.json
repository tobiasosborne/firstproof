Define phi(t) = 1/Phi_n(p boxplus G_t). By concavity, phi is concave. As t -\u003e infinity, phi(t) ~ C_n*t (asymptotically linear). Now consider the two-parameter family: 1/Phi_n((p boxplus G_s) boxplus (q boxplus G_t)) = 1/Phi_n((p boxplus q) boxplus G_{s+t}) = psi(s+t) where psi(u) = 1/Phi_n((p boxplus q) boxplus G_u) is concave. At s=t=0: psi(0) = 1/Phi_n(p boxplus q). By Fisher superadditivity applied to (p boxplus G_s) and (q boxplus G_t): 1/Phi_n(r_{s+t}) \u003e= 1/Phi_n(p_s) + 1/Phi_n(q_t). Taking s,t -\u003e 0 recovers the conjecture. The key step is proving this limit interchange is valid using the concavity structure.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"b545dc2ff8f315e55225d34b5770e6d6e4440e6ba8d1ce15fc1016a858d94005","created":"2026-02-08T18:16:45.410336678Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
