Adapt this derivation to the finite free setting using de Bruijn (node 1.4.1) and Gaussian splitting (node 1.4.4). The key is verifying that the differentiation and limit operations are valid for polynomial entropy.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"0b2bae5c43929b10fed20299921f27f02f2e09ffc89791760094ab1b4f2cf141","created":"2026-02-08T18:16:48.236555841Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
