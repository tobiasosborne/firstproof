The MSS convolution structure as an expectation over Haar measure makes it amenable to concentration and log-Sobolev techniques. If EPI holds with a sharp constant, the Stam inequality follows with equality at n=2.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"cef8d177a477d004ca9531f7c28029b077c6d1a3ef0222aa324140ed7ca5921c","created":"2026-02-08T18:16:48.236557341Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
