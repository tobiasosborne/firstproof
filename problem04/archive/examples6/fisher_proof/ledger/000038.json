The equation G_r(z) = G_p(w) in the variable w is equivalent to a polynomial equation obtained by clearing denominators. Starting from (1/n) r'(z)/r(z) = (1/n) p'(w)/p(w), cross-multiply to get r'(z) p(w) = p'(w) r(z). Since p is monic of degree n, we have p(w) = w^n + a_1 w^{n-1} + ... and p'(w) = n w^{n-1} + (n-1)a_1 w^{n-2} + .... The polynomial F(w) := r'(z) p(w) - p'(w) r(z) has: coefficient of w^n equal to r'(z), and coefficient of w^{n-1} equal to a_1 r'(z) - n r(z). This is a polynomial of degree n in w (the leading coefficient r'(z) is nonzero for z in C^+ since r has only real roots). However, w = z is NOT generically a root; the degree is genuinely n. CORRECTION TO STRATEGY DOC: The strategy document says degree n-1; the correct degree is n. The number of solutions of G_p(w) = c for generic c in C^- is n (not n-1), since G_p as a rational function hat(C) -\u003e hat(C) has degree n (it has n simple poles). Of these n preimages, we need exactly one in C^+. STATUS: This step is CORRECT modulo the degree correction (n not n-1).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"b2ef9d23ec2e78aa44c79034f0cf196776dc9fc660f28acd2b2ea7fce595ca4e","created":"2026-02-08T10:05:03.226588768Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
