{"type":"challenge_raised","timestamp":"2026-02-08T10:10:31.271027117Z","challenge_id":"ch-5b7087d3e2dcb6b2","node_id":"1.5.2","target":"gap","reason":"The central claim -- that exactly one of n preimages of G_p(w)=c lies in C^+ for c in C^- -- is stated without proof and the prover honestly labels it as a GENUINE GAP. This is the correct assessment. However, the node's status is 'pending' rather than explicitly marked as unproved/conjectural. Three specific issues with the proof attempts presented: (1) The winding number computation giving (n-1)/2 is wrong -- the correct argument principle computation requires careful treatment of the n boundary poles, each contributing +1/2 (from the upper semicircular indentations), plus contributions from the real segments; the total gives exactly 1 zero in C^+, but the prover did not complete this computation correctly. (2) The prover's claim that 'nG_p: C^+ -\u003e C^- is NOT degree 1' and the claim that 'G_p is NOT injective on C^+ for n\u003e=2' are BOTH CORRECT, but the conclusion that degree \\!= 1 is WRONG: degree 1 as a branched cover is compatible with critical points (the function can be degree 1 with critical points if the branch structure is compatible with the topology; in this case the conjugation symmetry ensures critical points in C^+ pair with those in C^-, preserving degree 1). (3) The correct proof follows from the Nevanlinna/Pick function theory: nG_p maps C^+ conformally onto C^- minus n-1 vertical slits (a standard result, see e.g. Donoghue 'Monotone Matrix Functions and Analytic Continuation' Ch. II), giving exactly one preimage. The prover should cite this classical result or provide the complete argument principle computation. As stated, this node contains no valid proof and should not be accepted.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
