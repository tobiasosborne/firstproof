By hypothesis (node 1.5), omega_1 : C^+ -\u003e C^+ is a Herglotz function, hence (when extended to R by continuity) it is monotone increasing on each connected component of R minus {poles of omega_1}. Suppose sigma(k) = sigma(ell) = j for k != ell, so omega_1(nu_k) = omega_1(nu_ell) = lambda_j. Since lambda_j is a root of p (hence a regular value — not a pole — of omega_1), both nu_k and nu_ell lie in regular intervals of omega_1. A Herglotz function restricted to a single monotone interval is strictly monotone, hence injective. Even if nu_k, nu_ell lie in different monotone intervals, the degree of omega_1 as a rational map (which equals n-1 from the construction in node 1.5) constrains the total number of real preimages. Since omega_1 maps n distinct real points {nu_1,...,nu_n} into {lambda_1,...,lambda_n} (which also has n elements), injectivity of sigma follows from a counting argument: omega_1 has at most n-1 poles on R (from the Herglotz representation), dividing R into at most n intervals, on each of which omega_1 is monotone. Each lambda_j can be hit at most once per interval, giving at most n preimages total for all lambda_j combined. Since we need exactly n preimages (one per nu_k), each lambda_j is hit exactly once.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"cc184069e606a1110d9b25a4d049970c9707b512e07224b23cb1d0e5864d7c8b","created":"2026-02-08T10:04:41.484800761Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
