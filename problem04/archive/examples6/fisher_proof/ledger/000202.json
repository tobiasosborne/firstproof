The main inequality remains UNPROVED. This is the sole substantive gap in the proof.\n\nSPECIFIC OBSTRUCTIONS:\n\n(1) NON-RATIONALITY OF SUBORDINATION FUNCTIONS. The omega_i are algebraic (degree n over C(z)), not rational. Therefore the Herglotz partial-fraction representation omega(z) = z + c + sum_j m_j/(z - p_j) does NOT apply. The previous proof strategy relied crucially on this rational structure, which is false.\n\n(2) IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION vs. POLE DECOMPOSITION. The correction vectors alpha_k = omega_1 double-prime(nu_k)/2 are determined by implicit differentiation of F(z,w) = r prime(z)p(w) - p prime(w)r(z) = 0. These are explicit rational expressions in the roots of p, q, r, but their structural properties (sign pattern, convexity, interlacing) are UNKNOWN.\n\n(3) NO FINITE SUMMATION RELATION. The free probability identity omega_1(z) + omega_2(z) = z + F(z) does NOT hold at finite n (verified computationally at n=2). No finite-n replacement coupling alpha and beta has been found.\n\n(4) PURE VECTOR INEQUALITY FAILS FOR ARBITRARY VECTORS. The inequality norm(h+alpha)^2 norm(h+beta)^2 \u003e= norm(h)^2(norm(h+alpha)^2 + norm(h+beta)^2) with constraint alpha - beta = u - v is FALSE for arbitrary alpha, beta. Counterexample: h=(1,0), alpha=(10,0), beta=(0,0) gives LHS=121 but RHS=122. The algebraic structure of omega_1, omega_2 MUST be exploited.\n\n(5) CANDIDATE ATTACK DIRECTIONS (all open): (a) Find finite-n coupling relation between omega_1 and omega_2. (b) Exploit the algebraic equation F(z,w) = 0 to constrain alpha, beta jointly. (c) Lorentzian polynomial or stable polynomial techniques (Borcea-Branden). (d) Induction on n using MSS derivative identity (node 1.3).\n\nSTATUS: This is a GENUINE and FUNDAMENTAL gap, not missing details in an otherwise complete argument.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"5c1e13509615069a1f36342bfedf7b4df73686bf2ae0eec528d37e1615bf4c0d","created":"2026-02-08T10:31:58.044847135Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
