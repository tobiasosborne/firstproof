The Taylor expansion of omega_1 at nu_k uses analyticity of the rational function at a non-pole point. The Laurent expansion of nG_p at a simple pole with residue 1 and constant term H_p is standard from the partial fraction decomposition. The composition is correctly stated. The claim omega_1'(nu_k) \u003e 0 follows from the Herglotz representation as noted."}
