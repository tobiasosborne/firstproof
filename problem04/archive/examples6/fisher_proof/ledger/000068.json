The prover should explicitly note that for z in C^+ (where r(z)\\!=0 since r has real roots), w=lambda_j is a root of F only if p'(lambda_j)r(z)=0, which is impossible since p has simple roots and r(z)\\!=0. This confirms no spurious solutions are introduced. The omission is minor since the conclusion (degree genuinely n, with n solutions) is correct.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
