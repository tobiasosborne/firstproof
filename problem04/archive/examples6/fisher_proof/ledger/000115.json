However, explicit computation at n=2 shows omega_1 is ALGEBRAIC (involves sqrt(z^4 - 6z^3 + 15z^2 - 18z + 10)), NOT rational. The discriminant polynomial has branch points at z = 1+i, 2+i in C^+, so omega_1 is not even single-valued holomorphic on all of C^+. Therefore the finite partial fraction form is INVALID, and the formula alpha_k = sum_j m_{1j}/(nu_k - p_{1j})^3 does not hold. The correct representation would use the Herglotz integral representation with a (possibly continuous) positive measure, giving alpha_k = integral 1/(nu_k - t)^3 dm(t), which has different structural properties than a finite sum. This fundamentally undermines the structural constraint on alpha, beta that the proof strategy relies on.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
