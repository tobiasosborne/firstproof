This is not how Im distributes over products of complex numbers. The correct and simpler argument is: f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) - nc * p(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) - nc * 0 = p'(lambda_i), which is real because p'(lambda_i) = prod_{j \\!= i}(lambda_i - lambda_j) is a product of real numbers. The conclusion is correct; only the intermediate formula is misleading.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
