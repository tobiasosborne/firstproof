Let n \u003e= 1 and let p in P_n with roots(p) = (lambda_1, ..., lambda_n). Define the finite free Fisher information of p as Phi_n(p) := sum_{i=1}^n [H_p(lambda_i)]^2 = sum_{i=1}^n [sum_{j=1, j!=i}^n 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j)]^2. By Definition 0.4, this equals sum_{i=1}^n [p\"(lambda_i) / (2 p(lambda_i))]^2. DOMAIN AND CONVENTION: Phi_n is defined as a function P_n -\u003e [0, +infinity). For monic degree-n polynomials p not in P_n (i.e., those with at least one repeated root), we adopt the convention Phi_n(p) = +infinity, consistent with the divergence of 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j) as lambda_i -\u003e lambda_j. PROPERTIES: (Phi1) NON-NEGATIVITY: Phi_n(p) \u003e= 0 for all p in P_n, since it is a sum of squares. (Phi2) VANISHING: Phi_n(p) = 0 if and only if n = 1. When n = 1, the sum over i has one term, and the inner sum over j != i is empty, giving H_p(lambda_1) = 0 and Phi_1(p) = 0. When n \u003e= 2, each H_p(lambda_i) involves at least one nonzero term 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j), and the sum of squares of n real numbers, each being a nonempty sum of nonzero terms, is strictly positive. (Phi3) TRANSLATION INVARIANCE: For all t in R, if q(x) = p(x - t), then roots(q) = (lambda_1 + t, ..., lambda_n + t), and the differences lambda_i - lambda_j are preserved, so Phi_n(q) = Phi_n(p). (Phi4) SCALING: For c \u003e 0, if q(x) = c^{-n} p(cx), then roots(q) = (lambda_1/c, ..., lambda_n/c), the differences scale by 1/c, so H_q(lambda_i/c) = c * H_p(lambda_i), and Phi_n(q) = c^2 Phi_n(p). (Phi5) ASYMPTOTIC CONNECTION: Phi_n is a finite analogue of Voiculescu free Fisher information Phi^*(mu) = integral (H_mu)^2 d mu [V98]. If the empirical root measures mu_p^{(n)} = (1/n) sum_i delta_{lambda_i/sqrt{n}} converge weakly to mu, then Phi_n(p)/n^2 -\u003e Phi^*(mu) as n -\u003e infinity.","new_statement":"DEFINITION 0.5 (Finite free Fisher information Phi_n).

Consider the extremal roots: for the smallest root lambda_1, every term in H_p(lambda_1) = sum_{j\u003e1} 1/(lambda_1 - lambda_j) is strictly negative (since lambda_1 \u003c lambda_j for all j \u003e 1), so H_p(lambda_1) \u003c 0. Therefore Phi_n(p) \u003e= H_p(lambda_1)^2 \u003e 0. (Note: interior roots may have H_p(lambda_i) = 0 due to cancellation, e.g. p(x) = x(x-1)(x-2) gives H_p(1) = 1/(1-0) + 1/(1-2) = 0, so the argument cannot rely on all terms being nonzero.)
