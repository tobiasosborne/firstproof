The function omega_1(z) is defined implicitly by the polynomial equation F(z, w) := r'(z) p(w) - p'(w) r(z) = 0, where F is a polynomial of degree n in w with coefficients that are rational functions of z (in fact polynomials in z of degree at most n). By Step 1.5.2 and Step 1.5.3, we have selected a single-valued holomorphic branch omega_1: C^+ -\u003e C^+ from the algebraic curve {(z,w) : F(z,w) = 0}. CLAIM: omega_1 extends to a rational function on hat(C). PROOF SKETCH: omega_1 is holomorphic on C^+ and continuous up to R (away from finitely many points). By the Schwarz reflection principle, omega_1 extends to a meromorphic function on C (since it maps C^+ to C^+ and R to R generically, reflection across R gives the extension to C^-). As a meromorphic function on hat(C) that satisfies an algebraic equation of degree n, omega_1 is algebraic. An algebraic function on hat(C) that is single-valued (i.e., defines a section of the algebraic curve) must be rational. GAP: The extension from C^+ to all of hat(C) requires showing: (1) omega_1 extends continuously to R away from finitely many points (plausible from the implicit function theorem applied to F(z,w) = 0 at real points where F_w != 0), (2) the Schwarz reflection principle applies (requires knowing omega_1 maps R to R, which follows from the real-coefficient structure of F and the selection of the branch), (3) the resulting meromorphic function on hat(C) is single-valued (this is where we use that omega_1 is already defined as a single-valued function on C^+, and the reflection gives a single-valued extension). STATUS: This step is PLAUSIBLE but has minor gaps in the details of boundary regularity and the reflection argument. The key mathematical content (that a single-valued holomorphic branch of an algebraic function on a simply connected domain extends to a rational function) is a standard result in complex analysis.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"cd0dc2d0ab2bbfafc897ae80fe01769728ec03eb160dcda50729f74d735a8d09","created":"2026-02-08T10:05:03.226618181Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
