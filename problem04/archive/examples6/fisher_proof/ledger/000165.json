This is WRONG: f(w) = p'(w) - nc*p(w) has complex coefficients. For real w, Im(f(w)) = -n*Im(c)*p(w). A real root of f requires both Re(f(w))=0 AND Im(f(w))=0. Since Im(c)\u003c0, Im(f(w))=0 iff p(w)=0, but f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) != 0. Therefore f HAS NO REAL ROOTS AT ALL. The IVT cannot be applied to a complex-valued function.\n\n(2) Challenge ch-01bf6ae01d5e0da3 says 'By the intermediate value theorem applied to Re(f) on R, f has exactly n-1 real roots.' This confuses roots of Re(f) with roots of f. Yes, Re(f(x)) for real x is a real polynomial with alternating signs at lambda_i, so Re(f) has n-1 real roots. But these are NOT roots of f since Im(f) != 0 there.\n\n(3) Challenge ch-5b7087d3e2dcb6b2 claims 'nG_p maps C^+ conformally onto C^- minus n-1 vertical slits, giving exactly one preimage.' If this slit-mapping claim were true, then nG_p would be injective on C^+. But for n=2, the equation nG_p(w) = -i has TWO solutions in C^+: w1=0.5+1.866i and w2=0.5+0.134i (both verified numerically). So either the slit-mapping result is being misapplied, or it applies to a different normalization.\n\nTHE CORRECT REFORMULATION: Since all n solutions of G_p(w) = c lie in C^+ for c in C^-, the subordination problem is not about isolating one C^+ root from others. Instead, it requires selecting a specific analytic branch omega_1(z) from the n-sheeted algebraic curve F(z,w) = 0, where all sheets lie over C^+. This is possible by the implicit function theorem plus analytic continuation, using the fact that the n branches are locally separated (the discriminant of F w.r.t. w is generically nonzero). The Herglotz property is then used to select the specific branch with the correct boundary behavior.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
