The equation G_p(w) = c is equivalent to (1/n) p'(w)/p(w) = c, i.e., p'(w) - nc p(w) = 0. Define f(w) := p'(w) - nc p(w). Since p(w) = w^n - s_1 w^{n-1} + ... is monic degree n and p'(w) = n w^{n-1} - (n-1)s_1 w^{n-2} + ... has degree n-1, we have f(w) = (-nc) w^n + n w^{n-1} + ... (lower order terms). Thus f is a polynomial of degree exactly n (since c != 0 for c in C^-) with leading coefficient (-nc). The roots of f in C are exactly the solutions of G_p(w) = c (excluding the poles of G_p, which are the roots of p; but f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) != 0 since p has simple roots, so the poles of G_p are NOT roots of f). Therefore f has exactly n roots in C (counted with multiplicity), and we must show exactly one lies in C^+.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"ff4f69000e471aa974127472c5b514573ee6dcbbeec015339ba0590f5875a73d","created":"2026-02-08T10:19:21.290853239Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
