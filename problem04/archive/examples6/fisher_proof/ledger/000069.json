{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-08T10:08:26.760201856Z","node_id":"1.4.3","note":"Verified: The formula Phi_2 = 2/(gap)^2 derived in node 1.4.1 for any monic degree-2 polynomial with simple roots is correctly applied to r. The substitution Delta_r^2 = (b-a)^2 + (d-c)^2 from node 1.4.2 is correct. Domain is valid since (b-a)^2 + (d-c)^2 \u003e 0 under the hypotheses a\u003cb, c\u003cd. The logical chain is sound: 1.4.1 provides the general n=2 formula, 1.4.2 provides the specific gap of r, and this node combines them."}
