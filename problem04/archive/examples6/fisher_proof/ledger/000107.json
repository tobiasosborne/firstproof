The construction via the selection principle gives omega_1(z) pointwise, but to be a 'function' in the analytic sense it must be shown to be holomorphic (or at least continuous). This would follow from the implicit function theorem applied to F(z,w) = 0 at the selected branch, but is not stated here. Presumably deferred to node 1.5.4 (Rationality), which is acceptable, but should be noted.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
