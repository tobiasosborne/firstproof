This corrective node provides the correct branch selection.\n\nSETUP. The algebraic equation F(z,w) := r'(z)p(w) - p'(w)r(z) = 0 defines an n-sheeted algebraic curve over the z-plane. Equivalently, this is the equation G_r(z) = G_p(w) (away from roots of p and r). By Step 1.5.2, when z in C^+ (upper half-plane), all n sheets w_1(z), ..., w_n(z) lie in C^+.\n\nPART 1: ASYMPTOTIC SELECTION OF THE PRINCIPAL BRANCH. For large |z| with Im(z) \u003e 0:\n- G_r(z) = (1/n) sum_i 1/(z - nu_i) ~ 1/z as z -\u003e infinity.\n- G_p(w) = (1/n) sum_j 1/(w - lambda_j) ~ 1/w as w -\u003e infinity.\n- The equation G_p(w) = G_r(z) ~ 1/z forces w ~ z for the branch where |w| -\u003e infinity.\nMore precisely, expanding the algebraic equation F(z,w) = 0 for large |z|, exactly one branch satisfies omega_1(z)/z -\u003e 1 as z -\u003e infinity along any ray in C^+. This is the PRINCIPAL BRANCH. The remaining n-1 branches satisfy w_k(z) -\u003e lambda_j (roots of p) as z -\u003e infinity, corresponding to the n-1 finite sheets.\n\nPART 2: LOCAL HOLOMORPHICITY. By the implicit function theorem, F(z,w) = 0 defines omega_1 as a locally holomorphic function of z wherever the partial derivative F_w(z, omega_1(z)) is nonzero. Since F_w(z,w) = r'(z) p'(w) - p''(w) r(z) vanishes at only finitely many points on the algebraic curve (the branch points), omega_1 is holomorphic on C^+ except possibly at finitely many branch points. At these branch points, omega_1 remains continuous (it is constrained to C^+ and cannot jump to a distant sheet) and hence holomorphic by Riemann's removable singularity theorem. Full analysis is in node 1.5.4.\n\nPART 3: HERGLOTZ PROPERTY. Since ALL n branches of the algebraic curve map C^+ into C^+ (by Step 1.5.2), any holomorphic branch — including the principal branch omega_1 — satisfies:\n  Im(omega_1(z)) \u003e 0 whenever Im(z) \u003e 0.\nThis is immediate and does not require uniqueness of the C^+ preimage.\n\nPART 4: SUBORDINATION IDENTITY. By construction, omega_1(z) solves G_p(w) = G_r(z), so:\n  G_r(z) = G_p(omega_1(z))\nholds identically on C^+ (wherever omega_1 is defined).\n\nPART 5: ANALOGOUS CONSTRUCTION FOR omega_2. Applying the same procedure to G_q in place of G_p yields omega_2: C^+ -\u003e C^+ satisfying G_r(z) = G_q(omega_2(z)) with omega_2(z)/z -\u003e 1 as z -\u003e infinity.\n\nPART 6: SUFFICIENCY FOR THE CHAIN RULE. The chain rule computation (node 1.6) uses only LOCAL data at the real roots nu_k of r: the values omega_1(nu_k), omega_1'(nu_k), omega_1''(nu_k). Near each nu_k (which is a real point generically not a branch point of the algebraic curve), the n branches of F(z,w) = 0 are locally separated (the discriminant is generically nonzero on R), so the principal branch omega_1 is locally well-defined and holomorphic near nu_k. This local data is unambiguous and independent of any global monodromy issues in C^+.\n\nDEPENDENCIES: Step 1.5.2 (all n preimages in C^+).","inference":"assumption","dependencies":["1.5.2"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"9d9aa9a839103aea3f5e09bf97977600bc23877dc7a3c4fcd6d8ec36fb3fc70d","created":"2026-02-08T10:32:15.711250755Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
