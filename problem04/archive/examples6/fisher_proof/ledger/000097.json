The prover's 'REVISED APPROACH' was actually on the right track. Here is a sketch of the complete proof: (1) Let f(w) = p'(w) - nc*p(w) where c in C^- (so Im(nc) \u003c 0). f has degree n with leading coefficient (-nc). (2) Evaluate f at the roots of p: f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) which is real and has alternating sign (p'(lambda_i) = prod_{j\\!=i}(lambda_i - lambda_j), alternating in sign). (3) By the intermediate value theorem applied to Re(f) on R (since f has real values at lambda_i but complex coefficients, one must work with the real polynomial Re(f(x)) for x real), f has exactly n-1 real roots (one in each interval (lambda_i, lambda_{i+1})). (4) The n-th root is non-real. Call it w_0. We must show Im(w_0) \u003e 0 (i.e., w_0 in C^+). (5) The product of all roots of f equals (-1)^n * (constant term) / (leading coefficient) = (-1)^n * f(0)/(-nc). Since the n-1 real roots are known, w_0 is determined. Alternatively: (6) By Vieta, sum of all roots = -(coefficient of w^{n-1})/(-nc) = [(n-1)a_1 - (-nc)*a_1*...]. Actually the cleanest argument: the n-1 real roots r_1,...,r_{n-1} are known to interlace with lambda_1,...,lambda_n. Then w_0 = (sum of all roots) - sum(r_j). The sum of all roots = (coefficient of w^{n-1} of f)/(-nc) = [(n-1)a_1 + nc*a_1*...] -- this gets messy. A cleaner approach: observe Im(product of all roots) = Im(a_n/(-nc)) and the real roots contribute a real product, so Im(w_0) * (product of real roots) contributes to matching. Since Im(1/(-nc)) \u003e 0, we get Im(w_0) \u003e 0 with the right sign. Or simply: use the argument principle with the correct contour (half-plane with small indentations) to directly compute the count = 1.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
