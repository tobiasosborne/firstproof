Equivalent formula H_p = p''/(2p') verified with concrete examples: p(x)=x(x-1) at both roots, and p(x)=x(x-1)(x-3) at all three roots. Edge case n=1: H_p = 0 (empty sum), consistent with p''=0. Laurent expansion interpretation correct. The proof presentation is messy (see minor challenge) but the final derivation and all stated results are mathematically correct."}
