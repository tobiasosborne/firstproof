{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-08T10:13:06.967475389Z","node_id":"1.6.5","note":"The Laurent expansion and residue matching are correct. Verified: (1) Geometric series expansion of 1/(a*t*(1+u)) = (1/(a*t))*(1-u+O(u^2)) with u = (b/(2a))*t gives the correct coefficient of t^{-1} and constant term. (2) The assembled expansion nG_p(omega_1(z)) = 1/(omega_1'*t) + [H_p - omega_1''/(2*omega_1'^2)] + O(t) is correct. (3) Matching with nG_r(z) = 1/(z-nu_k) + H_r(nu_k) + O(z-nu_k) at the (z-nu_k)^{-1} level gives omega_1'(nu_k) = 1. (4) The sign of the correction term -omega_1''/(2*omega_1'^2) is correct (verified against numerical data). (5) The extension to omega_2 by identical argument is valid."}
