Fix n \u003e= 1 and let p, q in P_n. Write the coefficient expansions p(x) = sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^{n-k} and q(x) = sum_{k=0}^n b_k x^{n-k}, where a_0 = b_0 = 1 (from monicity). Define r = p boxplus_n q to be the polynomial r(x) = sum_{k=0}^n c_k x^{n-k} in R[x], where for each k in {0, 1, ..., n}: c_k = sum_{i=0}^{k} binom_coeff(i,j,k,n) * a_i * b_j, with j = k - i, and binom_coeff(i,j,k,n) = (n-i)! * (n-j)! / (n! * (n-k)!). The sum ranges over all i in {0,...,min(k,n)} with j = k - i in {0,...,n}. PROPERTIES: (P1) c_0 = (n! * n!) / (n! * n!) * a_0 * b_0 = 1, so r is monic of degree n. (P2) c_1 = a_1 + b_1 (trace additivity: the sum of roots of r equals the sum of roots of p plus the sum of roots of q). (P3) boxplus_n is commutative: p boxplus_n q = q boxplus_n p (from symmetry of the formula in (a_i, b_j)). (P4) boxplus_n is associative [MSS15]. (P5) By ADMITTED RESULT A (node 1.2), if p, q in P_n then p boxplus_n q in P_n, so boxplus_n restricts to a binary operation boxplus_n : P_n x P_n -\u003e P_n. This is the Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava convolution [MSS15, Definition 4.1].","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"54367ae3f99043ec285d51ab024cee3773d62ae690f907424de38eb34bfa4a49","created":"2026-02-08T10:05:10.916165257Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
