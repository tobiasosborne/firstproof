Assuming Step 1.5.2 (that for each c in C^-, the equation nG_p(w) = nc has exactly one solution w in C^+), define omega_1(z) for z in C^+ as follows: compute c = G_r(z), which lies in C^- since G_r maps C^+ to C^-; then let omega_1(z) be the unique w in C^+ satisfying G_p(w) = c. By construction, omega_1(z) in C^+ for all z in C^+, which is the Herglotz property. Additionally, G_r(z) = G_p(omega_1(z)) holds by definition. The analogous construction for omega_2 using G_q gives G_r(z) = G_q(omega_2(z)) with omega_2: C^+ -\u003e C^+. STATUS: This step is CORRECT, conditional on Step 1.5.2. The Herglotz property is immediate from the construction — the content is entirely in the selection principle.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"f4c286e10726859b93e6b4966adce880d1ec704a370569e911f90643dbe54db2","created":"2026-02-08T10:05:03.226614152Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
