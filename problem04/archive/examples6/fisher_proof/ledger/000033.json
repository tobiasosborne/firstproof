Using the Chain Rule (node 1.6), define vectors in R^n: u_k = H_p(lambda_{sigma(k)}), v_k = H_q(mu_{tau(k)}), h_k = H_r(nu_k), alpha_k = omega_1''(nu_k)/2, beta_k = omega_2''(nu_k)/2. The chain rule gives u = h + alpha, v = h + beta. Since sigma, tau are bijections, Phi_n(p) = ||u||^2, Phi_n(q) = ||v||^2, Phi_n(r) = ||h||^2. This is a direct translation of the chain rule output into vector notation; no new content beyond node 1.6.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"9b619784cf3de11a6b8c8098c69cf35b4ee0781d34b9bae5e7df2a18d88f51c1","created":"2026-02-08T10:04:49.885977372Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
