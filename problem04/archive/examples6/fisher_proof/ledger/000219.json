The correct justification should cite the general Herglotz integral representation omega_1(z) = z + B + integral dmu(t)/(t-z), from which the same properties follow: (a) strict monotonicity via omega_1'(x) = 1 + integral dmu(t)/(t-x)^2 \u003e 0; (b) surjectivity on each interval between poles; (c) finitely many poles (omega_1 is algebraic). The CONCLUSION (m=0) is correct and the counting argument is valid. For an algebraic Herglotz function with real boundary values on R minus finitely many points, the measure mu is purely atomic, so the partial-fraction form is actually recoverable -- but this should be stated explicitly to resolve the inconsistency with node 1.5.4.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
