The polynomial f(w) = (-nc) w^n + n w^{n-1} + (lower order terms) has n roots w_1, ..., w_n in C (counted with multiplicity). By Vieta formula for the sum of roots: w_1 + ... + w_n = -n/(-nc) = n/(nc) = 1/c. Since c in C^- (write c = a + bi with b \u003c 0), we compute Im(1/c) = Im(conj(c)/|c|^2) = -b/|c|^2 \u003e 0 (since b \u003c 0). Therefore Im(w_1 + ... + w_n) = Im(1/c) \u003e 0. This means the sum of imaginary parts of all roots is strictly positive: sum_{j=1}^n Im(w_j) \u003e 0. In particular, at least one root has strictly positive imaginary part (lies in C^+).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"c3128e60867d9bcc721c0588b69560ecc82ceb123539eab93739d2f6b07aed7a","created":"2026-02-08T10:19:21.290874372Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
