Step 1 correctly establishes that real preimages of the lambda values under omega_1 must be roots of r. Step 2 correctly counts preimages: on each interval between consecutive poles, omega_1 is continuous, strictly increasing, and surjective onto R (from the Herglotz property), so each lambda_j is hit exactly once per interval, giving n(m+1) preimages total. Since all lie in {nu_1,...,nu_n}, we get m=0. Step 3 correctly deduces order-preserving (hence injective) sigma from global strict monotonicity. Minor issue noted in challenge ch-9330812e5b0: Step 2 cites the rational partial-fraction Herglotz form, which contradicts node 1.5.4's claim that omega_1 is algebraic (not rational). However, the same properties follow from the general Herglotz integral representation, so the conclusion is unaffected."}
