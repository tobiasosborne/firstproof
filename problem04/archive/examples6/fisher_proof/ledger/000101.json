The argument claims: 'omega_1 has at most n-1 poles on R, dividing R into at most n intervals. Each lambda_j can be hit at most once per interval, giving at most n preimages total for all lambda_j combined. Since we need exactly n preimages (one per nu_k), each lambda_j is hit exactly once.' This reasoning is flawed in two ways: (1) The phrase 'at most n preimages total for all lambda_j combined' is unclear and does not yield a useful bound. On each interval, omega_1 can hit EACH of the n values lambda_j once, and different nu_k on the same interval could map to different lambda_j values. (2) The conclusion 'each lambda_j is hit exactly once' does not follow from the premises. Having n source points mapping to n target values with at most n preimages per value does not imply injectivity -- it is consistent with some values being hit twice and others not at all. A correct proof of injectivity needs to either: (a) use the interlacing structure of roots and poles more carefully to show that each monotone interval of omega_1 contains exactly one root of r and maps it to a distinct root of p, or (b) use the fact that omega_1 has degree n-1 together with the observation that G_p(omega_1(z)) = G_r(z) forces a specific structure on the preimage distribution, or (c) appeal to the analytic continuation / uniqueness of the subordination function. The argument as stated does not close.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
