Numerical computation for n=2 (p(x)=x(x-1), c=-i/2) and n=3 (p(x)=x(x-1)(x-2), multiple c values in C^-) shows that ALL n roots of G_p(w) = c lie in C^+, not just one.\n\nPROOF THAT ALL ROOTS LIE IN C^+: nG_p(w) = sum 1/(w - lambda_i) satisfies: (1) maps C^+ to C^- (node 1.1.4 G3), and (2) nG_p(conj(w)) = conj(nG_p(w)) since all lambda_i are real. From (2), nG_p maps C^- to C^+. So solutions of nG_p(w) = nc with nc in C^- require w in C^+ (the only region mapping to C^-). On R, nG_p is real-valued (away from poles), so no real solutions. On C^-, nG_p maps to C^+, not C^-. ALL n roots lie in C^+.\n\nCOMPUTED COUNTEREXAMPLES: n=2, p(x)=x(x-1), c=-i/2: roots w1=0.5+1.866i and w2=0.5+0.134i, BOTH in C^+. n=3, p(x)=x(x-1)(x-2), c=-i/2: roots w1=1.0+1.638i, w2=1.612+0.181i, w3=0.388+0.181i, ALL in C^+. Tested 10+ values, same result.\n\nIMPACT: The subordination construction requires selecting ONE branch from n solutions ALL in C^+. This is an analytic continuation / implicit function theory problem, not a C^+ vs C^- separation. The IVT-based and argument-principle-based strategies in the node are irrelevant. The existing challenges also contain the same error (claiming n-1 real roots via IVT, which is false since f has no real roots at all when c is complex).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
