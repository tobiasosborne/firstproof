It should explicitly note that for n=1, Phi_1(p) = 0, so the reciprocal form 1/Phi_n is undefined (or infinite), and this case must be excluded or handled separately. For n \u003e= 2, positivity of Phi_n follows not merely from 'simple roots' but from the fact that H_p(lambda_1) \u003c 0 (all terms in the sum are negative when lambda_1 is the smallest root), giving Phi_n(p) \u003e= H_p(lambda_1)^2 \u003e 0. The node's justification 'positive since p,q,r have simple roots' is insufficient as stated -- simple roots alone do not prevent cancellation in the sums defining H_p.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
