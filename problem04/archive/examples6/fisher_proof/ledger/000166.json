This claim is FALSE: ALL n solutions lie in C^+ (proved analytically and verified numerically for n=2,3 -- see challenge ch-e44081fff1974de8 on node 1.5.2).\n\nCONSEQUENCE: The construction 'let omega_1(z) be THE UNIQUE w in C^+ satisfying G_p(w) = c' is ill-defined because there are n such w, not one. The Herglotz property (omega_1: C^+ -\u003e C^+) would still hold for ANY choice of branch (since all branches map to C^+), but the construction as stated does not uniquely determine omega_1.\n\nREQUIRED FIX: The selection principle needs to be reformulated. Instead of uniqueness from the root-counting argument, the selection of omega_1 must use a different criterion (e.g., analytic continuation from z = infinity where nG_p(w) ~ n/w determines a unique branch, or using the asymptotic behavior G_r(z) ~ G_p(z) ~ 1/z as z -\u003e infinity to fix the branch with omega_1(z) ~ z).\n\nThis node's validated status should be revoked pending correction of the foundation in 1.5.2.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
