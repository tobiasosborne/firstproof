{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-08T10:13:37.77873116Z","node_id":"1.6.6","note":"The chain rule identity is correctly assembled from the Laurent expansion. With omega_1'(nu_k) = 1 established in node 1.6.5, the constant-term matching gives H_r(nu_k) = H_p(lambda_{sigma(k)}) - omega_1''(nu_k)/2, which is the desired identity with alpha_k = omega_1''(nu_k)/2. The sign is correct (verified against numerical data at n=2). The extension to omega_2 is valid by identical reasoning. Note: the overall chain rule proof remains incomplete due to the major challenge on node 1.6.2 (injectivity of sigma)."}
