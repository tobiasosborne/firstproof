This is FALSE. Constraint (ii) in node 1.7.3 assumes omega_i has a rational partial fraction form omega_i(z) = z + c_i + sum_j m_{ij}/(z - p_{ij}), but explicit computation at n=2 shows omega_1(z) = (-sqrt((z^2-4z+5)(z^2-2z+2)) + (z-2)(z+1))/(2z-3), which is ALGEBRAIC of degree 2 over Q(z), NOT rational. The discriminant z^4-6z^3+15z^2-18z+10 has branch points at z=1+i, 2+i IN C^+, meaning omega_1 is not even single-valued on C^+. The finite partial fraction representation is invalid, and the formula alpha_k = sum_j m_{1j}/(nu_k - p_{1j})^3 does not hold. The status assessment should flag this non-rationality as an additional fundamental gap beyond those listed.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
