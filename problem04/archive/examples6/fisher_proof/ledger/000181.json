The polynomial f(w) = (-nc) w^n + n w^{n-1} + (lower order terms) has n roots w_1, ..., w_n in C (counted with multiplicity). By Vieta formula for the sum of roots: w_1 + ... + w_n = -n/(-nc) = n/(nc) = 1/c. Since c in C^- (write c = a + bi with b \u003c 0), we compute Im(1/c) = Im(conj(c)/|c|^2) = -b/|c|^2 \u003e 0 (since b \u003c 0). Therefore Im(w_1 + ... + w_n) = Im(1/c) \u003e 0. This means the sum of imaginary parts of all roots is strictly positive: sum_{j=1}^n Im(w_j) \u003e 0. In particular, at least one root has strictly positive imaginary part (lies in C^+).","new_statement":"NO ROOTS IN C^- (Part B of the proof). Suppose for contradiction that w_0 in C^- (i.e., Im(w_0) \u003c 0) satisfies f(w_0) = 0, i.e., p'(w_0) - nc p(w_0) = 0. Since p has only real roots, p(w_0) \\!= 0, so we can divide: p'(w_0)/p(w_0) = nc. The left side equals nG_p(w_0) = sum_{i=1}^n 1/(w_0 - lambda_i). Compute the imaginary part: Im(1/(w_0 - lambda_i)) = -Im(w_0)/|w_0 - lambda_i|^2. Since Im(w_0) \u003c 0, each term has Im = |Im(w_0)|/|w_0 - lambda_i|^2 \u003e 0. Therefore Im(nG_p(w_0)) = sum_{i=1}^n |Im(w_0)|/|w_0 - lambda_i|^2 \u003e 0, which means nG_p(w_0) is in C^+ (upper half-plane). But nc is in C^- (since Im(nc) = n Im(c) \u003c 0 for c in C^-). This is a contradiction: nG_p(w_0) in C^+ cannot equal nc in C^-. Therefore f has no roots in C^-. QED for Part B. NOTE: This argument is the heart of the proof and uses only the elementary fact that the Cauchy transform of a real-rooted polynomial maps C^- to C^+ (the anti-Herglotz property of G_p restricted to C^-).","owner":"prover-select"}
