Complete rigorous proof, all 4 steps VALIDATED.\n  n = 3,4,5,10: NUMERICALLY VERIFIED (40,000 random trials, 0 violations).\n  General n \u003e= 3: OPEN. Strict inequality expected.\n\nCRITICAL PATH:\n  Definitions (1.1)           ESTABLISHED\n  Admitted results (1.2-1.3)  ADMITTED (standard literature)\n  Base case n=2 (1.4)         PROVED (equality, all VALIDATED)\n  Subordination (1.5)         ESTABLISHED (corrected: algebraic not rational)\n  Chain rule (1.6)            ESTABLISHED (follows from subordination, 4/6 VALIDATED)\n  Main inequality (1.7)       OPEN (Hard Lemma 2, sole remaining gap)\n\nThe proof reduces the full conjecture to a single vector inequality involving correction terms from algebraic subordination functions. The gap is isolated, precisely characterized, and the obstruction (non-rationality preventing Herglotz partial-fraction analysis) is well understood.\n\nOVERALL: OPEN for general n. Closing requires new structural insight into algebraic subordination or an entirely different proof technique.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"e3802e18ba364f953c7900f8cd22597f915f6d7cba354150ba37e90f1df70c13","created":"2026-02-08T10:31:58.044867036Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
