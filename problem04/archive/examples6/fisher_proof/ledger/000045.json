Let p in P_n with roots(p) = (lambda_1, ..., lambda_n). Define the Cauchy transform G_p : C \\ {lambda_1, ..., lambda_n} -\u003e C by G_p(z) = (1/n) * p(z)/p(z) = (1/n) sum_{i=1}^n 1/(z - lambda_i). PROOF OF EQUALITY: Since p(z) = prod_{i=1}^n (z - lambda_i), logarithmic differentiation gives d/dz [log p(z)] = p(z)/p(z) = sum_{i=1}^n 1/(z - lambda_i), establishing the equivalence. PROPERTIES: (G1) G_p is a rational function with numerator of degree n-1 and denominator of degree n (i.e., rational degree (n-1, n)). (G2) G_p has n simple poles, located exactly at the roots lambda_1, ..., lambda_n, each with residue exactly 1/n. Proof: Res(G_p, lambda_i) = lim_{z-\u003elambda_i} (z - lambda_i) * (1/n) * sum_{j=1}^n 1/(z - lambda_j) = 1/n. (G3) G_p maps the upper half-plane to the lower half-plane: for z in C^+ = {z in C : Im(z) \u003e 0}, we have Im(G_p(z)) = -(1/n) sum_{i=1}^n Im(z)/|z - lambda_i|^2 \u003c 0, so G_p(z) in C^- = {z in C : Im(z) \u003c 0}. (G4) Asymptotic behavior: G_p(z) = 1/z + O(1/z^2) as |z| -\u003e infinity, which follows from the partial fraction expansion.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"4470c0cb3d1104d83d813cdae6ce4d06284573ca1726d9a428704bc8049d8be0","created":"2026-02-08T10:05:10.916170753Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
