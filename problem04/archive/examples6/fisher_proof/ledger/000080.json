The reciprocals 1/Phi_2(p) = (b-a)^2/2, 1/Phi_2(q) = (d-c)^2/2, and 1/Phi_2(r) = ((b-a)^2+(d-c)^2)/2 are correctly computed. The final addition (b-a)^2/2 + (d-c)^2/2 = ((b-a)^2+(d-c)^2)/2 is trivially correct. Domain validity confirmed: all Fisher informations are strictly positive under hypotheses a\u003cb, c\u003cd. The conclusion that equality (not just inequality) holds at n=2 is correct and matches the proof strategy."}
