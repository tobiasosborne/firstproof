(i) Compatibility: alpha - beta = u - v, since h = u - alpha = v - beta. This is not a free parameter -- it is determined by p, q, r. (ii) Herglotz curvature constraint: from the partial fraction representation omega_i(z) = z + c_i + sum_j m_{ij}/(z - p_{ij}) with m_{ij} \u003e 0, we get omega_i''(nu_k) = sum_j 2 m_{ij}/(nu_k - p_{ij})^3. So alpha_k = sum_j m_{1j}/(nu_k - p_{1j})^3 and beta_k = sum_j m_{2j}/(nu_k - p_{2j})^3. These are NOT arbitrary vectors -- they have the specific structure of discrete Cauchy-type transforms of positive measures evaluated at the roots of r.

This is a linear relation determined by p, q, r and is not a free parameter.\n\n(ii) IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION CONSTRAINT (corrected — replaces false rational partial-fraction claim):\n\nThe previous version of this node claimed omega_i has a rational partial-fraction representation omega_i(z) = z + c_i + sum_j m_{ij}/(z - p_{ij}). This is FALSE: as established in the corrected node 1.5.4, omega_1 is an ALGEBRAIC function of degree n over C(z), not a rational function. The standard rational Herglotz partial-fraction formula does NOT apply.\n\nWHAT IS CORRECT: omega_1 is a Herglotz (Nevanlinna) function on C^+, meaning Im(omega_1(z)) \u003e 0 when Im(z) \u003e 0. By the chain rule (node 1.6.5), omega_1'(nu_k) = 1 \u003e 0 at each root nu_k of r.\n\nThe correction terms alpha_k = omega_1''(nu_k)/2 are determined by the algebraic equation F(z,w) = r'(z)p(w) - p'(w)r(z) = 0 via implicit differentiation. Differentiating F(z, omega_1(z)) = 0 twice with respect to z:\n\n  First derivative: F_z + F_w * omega_1' = 0, giving omega_1' = -F_z/F_w.\n  Second derivative: F_{zz} + 2 F_{zw} omega_1' + F_{ww} (omega_1')^2 + F_w omega_1'' = 0.\n\nAt z = nu_k with omega_1(nu_k) = lambda_{sigma(k)} and omega_1'(nu_k) = 1:\n\n  alpha_k = omega_1''(nu_k)/2 = -[F_{zz} + 2 F_{zw} + F_{ww}]/(2 F_w),\n\nwhere all partial derivatives of F are evaluated at (nu_k, lambda_{sigma(k)}). These partial derivatives are explicitly computable from p, r and their derivatives.\n\nWHAT IS NOT KNOWN: Characterizing the structural properties of the vector alpha = (alpha_1, ..., alpha_n) from this implicit differentiation formula is an OPEN PROBLEM. In particular:\n- The sign pattern of alpha_k is not determined a priori.\n- The alpha_k are NOT of the form sum_j m_j/(nu_k - p_j)^3 with m_j \u003e 0 (as was falsely claimed).\n- Whether the alpha_k satisfy any positivity, convexity, or interlacing constraint that could imply the target inequality is unknown.\n\n(iii) FINITE SUMMATION RELATION (unchanged, correct): The continuum summation relation omega_1 + omega_2 = z + F_{mu boxplus nu}(z) does NOT hold at finite n (verified computationally at n=2). A finite replacement coupling alpha and beta is unknown.\n\nSTATUS: Constraint (i) is exact. Constraint (ii) has been corrected to remove the false rational partial-fraction claim; the alpha_k are determined by implicit differentiation of the algebraic equation, but their structural properties are an open problem. Constraint (iii) identifies the absence of a finite summation relation. The gap identified by the verifier (challenge ch-90f09f15fdf) is a GENUINE and FUNDAMENTAL issue: the proof strategy in node 1.7.4 relied on Herglotz-type structural constraints on alpha, beta that do not hold in the algebraic (non-rational) setting.","owner":"prover-alg"}
