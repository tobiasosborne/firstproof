As z -\u003e nu_k (a root of r), nG_r(z) has a simple pole with residue 1, since nG_r(z) = sum_{i=1}^n 1/(z - nu_i). By the subordination identity G_r(z) = G_p(omega_1(z)), we have nG_p(omega_1(z)) = nG_r(z) -\u003e infinity as z -\u003e nu_k. Since nG_p(w) = sum_{j=1}^n 1/(w - lambda_j) diverges only when w -\u003e lambda_j for some j, we must have omega_1(nu_k) = lambda_j for some j in {1,...,n}. Define sigma(k) := j. Similarly, from G_r(z) = G_q(omega_2(z)), define tau(k) by omega_2(nu_k) = mu_{tau(k)}.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"1c877ad4c0b4b8c462c67b4816e7cb210ab8e67523d64aa6c1bc1c21dc2be523","created":"2026-02-08T10:04:41.484788608Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
