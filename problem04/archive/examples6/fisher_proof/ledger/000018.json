Let p in P_n with roots(p) = (lambda_1, ..., lambda_n). Define the finite free Fisher information of p as Phi_n(p) = sum_{i=1}^n H_p(lambda_i)^2 = sum_{i=1}^n (sum_{j\\!=i} 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j))^2. Equivalently, Phi_n(p) = sum_{i=1}^n [p''(lambda_i) / (2 p'(lambda_i))]^2 by Definition 0.4. Properties: (1) Phi_n(p) \u003e= 0 for all p in P_n, with Phi_n(p) = 0 if and only if n = 1 (in which case the sum is empty). (2) Phi_n is invariant under translation: Phi_n(p(x - t)) = Phi_n(p) for all t in R, since the differences lambda_i - lambda_j are preserved. (3) Phi_n scales as Phi_n(p(x/c)) = c^2 Phi_n(p) for c \u003e 0, since lambda_i -\u003e c lambda_i sends 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j) -\u003e 1/(c(lambda_i - lambda_j)). (4) Convention: for polynomials with repeated roots (p not in P_n), set Phi_n(p) = +infinity, consistent with the divergence of 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j) as roots coalesce. (5) Context: Phi_n is a finite analogue of Voiculescu's free Fisher information Phi^*(mu) = integral (H mu)^2 d mu [V98]. In the large-n limit, with empirical root measures converging weakly, Phi_n(p)/n^2 -\u003e Phi^*(mu).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"dc156bc4d1638fb749924117f9b671a042be2273032dbfa6d8b127080f5572c4","created":"2026-02-08T10:03:56.055766341Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
