{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-08T10:11:54.297539338Z","node_id":"1.5.3","note":"Node 1.5.3 is CORRECT conditional on Node 1.5.2 (the selection principle). The Herglotz property follows tautologically from the construction: omega_1(z) is defined as the unique element of C^+ satisfying G_p(omega_1(z)) = G_r(z), so omega_1(z) in C^+ by definition. The conditioning on 1.5.2 is explicitly stated. Minor issues: (1) formal dependency on 1.5.2 not declared, (2) holomorphicity of omega_1 not addressed (deferred to 1.5.4). ACCEPTED with the understanding that this node inherits the gap from 1.5.2."}
