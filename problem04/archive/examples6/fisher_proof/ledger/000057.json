(2) MSS formula with n=2: k=0 gives c_0=1, k=1 gives c_1=-(a+b+c+d) with both binomial coefficients equal to 1, k=2 gives c_2=ab+cd+(a+b)(c+d)/2 with the critical middle coefficient 1/2 from (1!*1!)/(2!*0!)=1/2. (3) Discriminant expansion verified term by term: cross terms 2(a+b)(c+d) cancel exactly, leaving (a-b)^2+(c-d)^2. (4) Positivity of D follows from a\u003cb and c\u003cd. (5) Root gap formula correct."}
