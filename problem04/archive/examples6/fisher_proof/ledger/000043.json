Fix a positive integer n \u003e= 1. Define P_n to be the set of all polynomials p in R[x] satisfying the following two conditions: (a) MONIC OF DEGREE n: p(x) = x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + ... + a_n for some a_1, ..., a_n in R. Equivalently, p has degree exactly n and leading coefficient 1. (b) n DISTINCT REAL ROOTS: there exist real numbers lambda_1 \u003c lambda_2 \u003c ... \u003c lambda_n (strict inequalities) such that p(x) = prod_{i=1}^n (x - lambda_i). We define the function roots : P_n -\u003e R^n by roots(p) = (lambda_1, ..., lambda_n), which is well-defined since the ordered n-tuple of roots is uniquely determined by p. CONSEQUENCES: (i) Every root is simple: for each i in {1,...,n}, p(lambda_i) = prod_{j != i} (lambda_i - lambda_j) != 0, since all roots are distinct. (ii) P_n is nonempty: for example, p(x) = prod_{i=1}^n (x - i) lies in P_n for every n \u003e= 1. (iii) P_n is an open subset of the space of monic degree-n polynomials (in the coefficient topology), since the discriminant disc(p) = prod_{i\u003cj} (lambda_i - lambda_j)^2 \u003e 0 on P_n and the discriminant is a continuous function of the coefficients.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"4fbe4858be6f957883c9e75d934f4935e1dc88d1bcdc9ebb542fc6fd6c2d95b9","created":"2026-02-08T10:05:10.916160677Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
