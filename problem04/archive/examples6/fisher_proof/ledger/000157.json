For real w, define g(w) := Re(f(w)) and h(w) := Im(f(w)). From Step 1.5.2.2: f(lambda_i) is real for each i, so h(lambda_i) = 0 and g(lambda_i) = f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) with alternating signs. Since h is a continuous real-valued function on R with h(lambda_i) = 0 for all i, and g is continuous with g(lambda_i) alternating in sign, the function f itself (restricted to R) satisfies: on each interval (lambda_i, lambda_{i+1}), f is continuous and f(lambda_i), f(lambda_{i+1}) are real with opposite signs. More precisely: for a root r of f on R we need f(r) = 0, i.e., BOTH g(r) = 0 AND h(r) = 0. This is where we must be careful. For a complex polynomial f with complex coefficients, the existence of real roots between lambda_i and lambda_{i+1} is NOT immediate from IVT alone, since f takes complex values on R. CORRECTION: Consider instead the auxiliary real polynomial F(w) := |f(w)|^2 restricted to R, or better, use the following cleaner argument. Since f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) are all real with alternating signs, and f is a polynomial (hence continuous), the REAL PART Re(f(w)) changes sign on each interval (lambda_i, lambda_{i+1}), so Re(f) has at least one real root in each such interval. Similarly, Im(f(lambda_i)) = 0 for all i. But we need SIMULTANEOUS vanishing. The correct approach: consider the polynomial f(w) = p'(w) - nc p(w) for REAL c first (as a limiting/perturbation argument), where f has n-1 real roots by standard IVT (since f is then a real polynomial with alternating signs at lambda_i). For c_0 real with c = c_0 + i epsilon (epsilon \u003c 0, small), f(w; c) = f(w; c_0) - i n epsilon p(w) is a small perturbation. The n-1 simple real roots of f(w; c_0) persist as n-1 roots near the real axis. But we need to show they remain EXACTLY real. ALTERNATIVE CLEANER ARGUMENT: Consider the polynomial f(w) = p'(w) - nc p(w) where nc = alpha + i beta with beta \u003c 0 (since c in C^-, Im(nc) = n Im(c) \u003c 0). Decompose f = f_R + i f_I where f_R(w) = p'(w) - alpha p(w) (a REAL polynomial of degree n) and f_I(w) = -beta p(w) (a REAL polynomial of degree n). The real roots of f on R are exactly the common real roots of f_R and f_I. Now f_I(w) = -beta p(w), and since beta \u003c 0 we have -beta \u003e 0, so f_I(w) = 0 iff p(w) = 0, i.e., w in {lambda_1, ..., lambda_n}. But f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) != 0. Therefore f has NO real roots at all! Every root of f is non-real. Since f has degree n, all n roots are non-real. WAIT -- this contradicts our earlier claim of n-1 real roots. Let us re-examine. For real w, f(w) = 0 requires both p'(w) - alpha p(w) = 0 AND beta p(w) = 0. The second equation forces p(w) = 0 (since beta != 0), hence w = lambda_i for some i. But f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) != 0. So indeed f has NO real roots. All n roots of f are non-real.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"e6ed899433a5f78a8bcd1a38043dda100a65cedd31d39b7db276ee3ddd6193df","created":"2026-02-08T10:19:21.290866651Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
