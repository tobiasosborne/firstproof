Two external results are admitted without proof:\n\n(A) MSS REAL-ROOTEDNESS PRESERVATION (node 1.2, ADMITTED): If p, q in P_n, then r = p boxplus_n q in P_n. This is Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava [MSS15, Theorem 4.4]. Uses the method of interlacing families. Standard in the literature and widely accepted.\n\n(B) MSS DERIVATIVE IDENTITY (node 1.3, ADMITTED): (p boxplus_n q) prime(x) = n * (p^{(1)} boxplus_{n-1} q^{(1)})(x), where p^{(1)} = (1/n)p prime. This is [MSS15, Proposition 4.5]. Direct computation from the coefficient formula.\n\nIMPACT ASSESSMENT: Result (A) is used to ensure r has n simple real roots. Result (B) is not directly used in the current proof path but could enable an inductive approach. Neither admitted result causes the main gap.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"5ce54c29ab411e93c736bbca52ba4ad9f87eb04d339ea89fb58fd1d9a379bf17","created":"2026-02-08T10:31:58.044862569Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
