The first expression 'p(z)/p(z)' is identically 1, making the claimed equality 1/n = (1/n) sum 1/(z - lambda_i), which is FALSE. The correct formula is G_p(z) = (1/n) * p'(z)/p(z) — the prime (derivative) is missing from the first p(z). The parent node 1.1 correctly writes p'(z)/p(z), and the proof of equality in this node correctly references p'(z)/p(z), confirming the intent. But the literal defining formula as written is wrong. A definition must be EXACTLY correct. The second defining expression (partial fraction) is correct and unambiguous, so the mathematical content is recoverable, but the p(z)/p(z) typo must be corrected to p'(z)/p(z).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
