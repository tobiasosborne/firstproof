Commutativity follows from symmetry of the coefficient formula (verified by index substitution). Edge case n=1: boxplus_1 adds roots, consistent. All factorial denominators well-defined (n-k \u003e= 0, n-i \u003e= 0, n-j \u003e= 0). Closure in P_n correctly deferred to admitted result (node 1.2). Definition is well-posed and precise."}
