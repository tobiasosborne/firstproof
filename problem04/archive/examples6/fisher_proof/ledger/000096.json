The prover writes: 'f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) (since p(lambda_i) = 0), and the signs of p'(lambda_i) alternate... So f has at least n-1 real roots... Since f has degree n, it has exactly n roots total, so at most 1 non-real root. Since non-real roots come in conjugate pairs, there are either 0 or 2 non-real roots, but we can have at most 1, so there are 0 non-real roots.' The prover then catches the error: f has COMPLEX coefficients since c in C^-, so non-real roots need NOT come in conjugate pairs. GOOD -- this self-correction is honest. However, the prover fails to note that even the intermediate claim 'f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) and signs alternate' is incomplete: while signs of p'(lambda_i) do alternate (standard property of polynomials with simple real roots), the claim that f(w) = p'(w) - nc*p(w) has a sign change between consecutive lambda_i depends on f being real-valued at the lambda_i, which it IS (since p(lambda_i) = 0 so f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) is real). So f does have n-1 real roots. But f has degree n with complex leading coefficient -nc, so the n-th root need not be real or come with a conjugate partner. The n-th root is IN FACT in C^+ when Im(c) \u003c 0 (equivalently Im(nc) \u003c 0). This is the content of the selection principle, and it CAN be proved by tracking the argument of the leading coefficient. The prover did not reach this conclusion.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
