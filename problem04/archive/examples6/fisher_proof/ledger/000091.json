While the FINAL derivation using h(x) = p(x)/(x-lambda_i) and the decomposition f = 1/(x-lambda_i) + g_i is CORRECT, the preceding ~60% of the proof text is wrong and confusing. A clean proof should be: (1) write p'(x) = h(x) + (x-lambda_i)h(x)g_i(x) where h = prod_{m\\!=i}(x-lambda_m), g_i = sum_{j\\!=i}1/(x-lambda_j); (2) differentiate and evaluate at lambda_i to get p''(lambda_i) = 2h(lambda_i)g_i(lambda_i) = 2p'(lambda_i)H_p(lambda_i). The definition itself and the equivalent formula are mathematically correct (verified with explicit examples p(x)=x(x-1) and p(x)=x(x-1)(x-3)).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
