{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-08T10:09:45.848944846Z","node_id":"1.7.2","note":"The algebraic equivalence between 1/||h||^2 \u003e= 1/||u||^2 + 1/||v||^2 and ||u||^2||v||^2 \u003e= ||h||^2(||u||^2+||v||^2) is correct for n \u003e= 2, where all norms-squared are strictly positive. The substitution u = h+alpha, v = h+beta is valid. Minor issue: the justification for positivity of all norms-squared is incomplete (needs the observation that H_p(lambda_1) \u003c 0 for n \u003e= 2, not just 'simple roots'), and the n=1 case should be excluded explicitly."}
