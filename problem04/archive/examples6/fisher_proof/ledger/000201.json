The following parts of the proof have been rigorously established:\n\n(A) DEFINITIONS (node 1.1): All definitions are well-posed. P_n (monic real-rooted degree-n with simple roots, node 1.1.2 VALIDATED), boxplus_n (MSS finite free additive convolution, node 1.1.3 VALIDATED), G_p (Cauchy transform, node 1.1.4), H_p (discrete Hilbert transform, node 1.1.5 VALIDATED), and Phi_n (finite free Fisher information, nodes 1.1.1, 1.1.6). The definition of H_p via p double-prime(lambda_i)/(2p prime(lambda_i)) and equivalence to the sum form are verified.\n\n(B) BASE CASE n=2 (node 1.4): EQUALITY holds: 1/Phi_2(r) = 1/Phi_2(p) + 1/Phi_2(q). All four sub-steps are VALIDATED (nodes 1.4.1-1.4.4). The proof is: Phi_2(p) = 2/(b-a)^2, discriminant of r = (b-a)^2 + (d-c)^2, hence 1/Phi_2(r) = ((b-a)^2 + (d-c)^2)/2 = 1/Phi_2(p) + 1/Phi_2(q). This is a complete, rigorous proof.\n\n(C) SUBORDINATION EXISTENCE (node 1.5): CORRECTED and established. For c in C^-, ALL n roots of G_p(w) = c lie in C^+ (nodes 1.5.2-1.5.2.6). This is stronger than originally claimed. The proof uses: (Part A) no real roots since Im(f(w)) = -beta*p(w) and p has simple roots; (Part B) no C^- roots since G_p maps C^- to C^+ (anti-Herglotz). Branch selection for omega_1: C^+ -\u003e C^+ via asymptotic condition omega_1(z) ~ z (node 1.5.3 VALIDATED). CRITICAL CORRECTION in node 1.5.4: omega_1 is ALGEBRAIC of degree n over C(z), NOT rational.\n\n(D) CHAIN RULE (node 1.6): Follows mechanically from subordination. Pole matching gives omega_1(nu_k) = lambda_{sigma(k)} (node 1.6.1 VALIDATED). Injectivity of sigma proved via no-real-poles argument (node 1.6.2). Laurent expansion: omega_1 prime(nu_k) = 1 (node 1.6.5 VALIDATED), H_r(nu_k) = H_p(lambda_{sigma(k)}) - alpha_k (node 1.6.6 VALIDATED).\n\n(E) VECTOR REFORMULATION (nodes 1.7.1-1.7.2): Correct translation: u = h + alpha, v = h + beta, target becomes norm(u)^2 norm(v)^2 \u003e= norm(h)^2(norm(u)^2 + norm(v)^2). Both nodes VALIDATED.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"71530a55085ba1d59171a4ff1db28193bd50a4dcf0057dda011b6a0429ca6867","created":"2026-02-08T10:31:58.044839824Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
