The node states the equivalent formula as 'sum_{i=1}^n [p\"(lambda_i) / (2 p(lambda_i))]^2'. The denominator is p(lambda_i), but p(lambda_i) = 0 since lambda_i is a ROOT of p. This makes the expression undefined (0/0 in the denominator). The correct formula (matching node 1.1.5 and the archived node 1.1.1) is p''(lambda_i) / (2 p'(lambda_i)) — with p-PRIME (first derivative) in the denominator, not p itself. The prime was dropped, turning a correct formula into division by zero.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
