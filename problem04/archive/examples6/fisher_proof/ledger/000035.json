(i) Compatibility: alpha - beta = u - v, since h = u - alpha = v - beta. This is not a free parameter -- it is determined by p, q, r. (ii) Herglotz curvature constraint: from the partial fraction representation omega_i(z) = z + c_i + sum_j m_{ij}/(z - p_{ij}) with m_{ij} \u003e 0, we get omega_i''(nu_k) = sum_j 2 m_{ij}/(nu_k - p_{ij})^3. So alpha_k = sum_j m_{1j}/(nu_k - p_{1j})^3 and beta_k = sum_j m_{2j}/(nu_k - p_{2j})^3. These are NOT arbitrary vectors -- they have the specific structure of discrete Cauchy-type transforms of positive measures evaluated at the roots of r. (iii) The continuum summation relation omega_1 + omega_2 = z + F_{mu boxplus nu}(z) does NOT hold at finite n (verified computationally at n=2). A finite replacement coupling alpha and beta is unknown.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"9911654c2f546a0ea18b428903f49a1372d8bf426ae7b9f1be41e03a4be64c97","created":"2026-02-08T10:04:49.886024189Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
