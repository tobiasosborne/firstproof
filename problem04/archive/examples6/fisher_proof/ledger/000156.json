Evaluate f at the roots lambda_1 \u003c ... \u003c lambda_n of p: f(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i) - nc p(lambda_i) = p'(lambda_i), since p(lambda_i) = 0. Now p'(lambda_i) = prod_{j != i} (lambda_i - lambda_j) is real and nonzero. The sign of p'(lambda_i) is (-1)^{n-i}: for i = n (largest root), all factors (lambda_n - lambda_j) with j \u003c n are positive, giving p'(lambda_n) \u003e 0; for i = n-1, we get one negative factor and (n-2) positive ones (from j \u003c n-1), giving p'(lambda_{n-1}) \u003c 0; in general the sign is (-1)^{n-i}. Crucially: f(lambda_i) is REAL for each i, and consecutive values f(lambda_i), f(lambda_{i+1}) have OPPOSITE signs (since (-1)^{n-i} and (-1)^{n-i-1} differ in sign). Note: although f has complex coefficients (since c in C^-), the values f(lambda_i) are real because the imaginary parts cancel: Im(f(lambda_i)) = Im(p'(lambda_i)) - Im(nc) Re(p(lambda_i)) - Re(nc) Im(p(lambda_i)) = 0 - Im(nc) * 0 - Re(nc) * 0 = 0, using p(lambda_i) = 0 and p'(lambda_i) real.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"4f1df055c26704cc0b7b71b827222f7125372de5b8b39de7800c54f85553266b","created":"2026-02-08T10:19:21.290862282Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
