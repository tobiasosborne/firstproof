There exist algebraic functions omega_1, omega_2, each of degree at most n over C(z), satisfying: (a) G_r(z) = G_p(omega_1(z)) = G_q(omega_2(z)) for all z in C^+, where omega_1, omega_2 are holomorphic on C^+. (b) omega_1, omega_2 : C^+ -\u003e C^+ (Herglotz/Nevanlinna property). More precisely, omega_1 is defined implicitly by F_1(z,w) := r'(z)p(w) - p'(w)r(z) = 0, selecting the unique branch in C^+ (see nodes 1.5.1-1.5.4). NOTE: omega_1 and omega_2 are NOT rational functions in general (see node 1.5.4 for the corrected analysis). For n=1 they are trivially rational (the identity); for n \u003e= 2 they are genuinely algebraic.","owner":"prover-alg"}
