Node 1.5.2 provides a selection principle (one preimage in C^+), and 1.5.3 defines omega_1 pointwise and shows it maps C^+ to C^+. But holomorphicity requires the implicit function theorem: at (z, omega_1(z)), F_w(z, omega_1(z)) must be nonzero. This is equivalent to omega_1(z) not being a critical point of G_p (as a function of w). The prover should either: (a) establish that F_w \\!= 0 at the selected branch for all z in C^+ (which requires showing the selected root in C^+ is never a critical point of the polynomial w -\u003e F(z,w)), or (b) address what happens at finitely many critical values where F_w = 0 and argue omega_1 is still holomorphic (removable singularity). This is a genuine gap in the argument, though it is likely fillable: at critical points, the branching structure of the algebraic curve could cause a branch switch, but since omega_1 is constrained to stay in C^+ (by the Herglotz property), it cannot switch to a C^- branch, which constrains the local behavior.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
