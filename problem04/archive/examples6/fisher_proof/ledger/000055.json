The set {disc \u003e 0} is indeed open, and P_n is contained in it, but {disc \u003e 0} is NOT equal to P_n for n \u003e= 4 (e.g., a degree-4 polynomial with two complex conjugate pairs also has disc \u003e 0). The correct argument requires noting that P_n is a connected component of {disc \\!= 0}, or that roots depend continuously on coefficients and real-distinctness is open by the implicit function theorem. The definition itself and consequences (i)-(ii) are correct; only the openness justification has a gap.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
