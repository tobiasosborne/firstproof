The claim that omega_1 maps R to R (required for Schwarz reflection) follows from: F(z,w) has REAL coefficients when z is real (since both p and r are real polynomials). So the algebraic curve is conjugation-symmetric. For real z (away from special points), the equation G_r(z) = G_p(w) is a real equation, and by the boundary behavior of G_p on R (monotone decreasing on each interval between poles), the real solutions are determined. The selected branch omega_1 is the limit as Im(z) -\u003e 0^+ of the unique C^+-preimage, which by continuity must converge to a real value. This argument works but should be made more explicit.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
