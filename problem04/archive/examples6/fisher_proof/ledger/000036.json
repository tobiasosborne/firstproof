WHAT IS ESTABLISHED: (a) The reformulation (Step 1) and equivalence (Step 2) are completely rigorous given node 1.6 (Chain Rule). (b) The constraints in Step 3 are correctly derived from the Herglotz representation. WHAT IS NOT ESTABLISHED (the gap): The central open problem is: what specific property of the Herglotz-constrained correction vectors (alpha, beta) implies the inequality ||h+alpha||^2 ||h+beta||^2 \u003e= ||h||^2(||h+alpha||^2 + ||h+beta||^2)? The inequality does NOT hold for arbitrary alpha, beta in R^n (easy to produce counterexamples). The Herglotz structure of alpha and beta must be essential. Three possible attack directions remain open: (1) Find the correct finite-n summation relation coupling omega_1 and omega_2, replacing the continuum relation. (2) Exploit the specific Cauchy-transform structure of alpha_k, beta_k as sums of signed cubics m/(nu_k - p_j)^3. (3) Use Lorentzian polynomial or interlacing techniques to bypass the analytic approach entirely. This node is UNPROVED and constitutes one of the two hard lemmas (alongside node 1.5, Finite Subordination) required for the main theorem.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"4208fb4f38fe496dd063d3acaa623ce8d28ddd0ac6b7bcb181ab258e7ea7e4bd","created":"2026-02-08T10:04:49.886026841Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
