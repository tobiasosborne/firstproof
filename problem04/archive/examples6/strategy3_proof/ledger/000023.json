Therefore:\n  sum_{k=1}^{n} H_p(lambda_{sigma(k)})^2 = sum_{i=1}^{n} H_p(lambda_i)^2 = Phi_n(p).\n\n  (This uses the elementary fact that summing f(sigma(k)) over k with sigma a permutation equals summing f(i) over i.)\n\nProof for ||v||^2 = Phi_n(q):\n  ||v||^2 = sum_{k=1}^{n} v_k^2\n           = sum_{k=1}^{n} H_q(mu_{tau(k)})^2.\n\n  Since tau is a bijection on {1,...,n} (from Node 1.2(a)):\n  sum_{k=1}^{n} H_q(mu_{tau(k)})^2 = sum_{j=1}^{n} H_q(mu_j)^2 = Phi_n(q).\n\nProof for ||h||^2 = Phi_n(r):\n  ||h||^2 = sum_{k=1}^{n} h_k^2\n           = sum_{k=1}^{n} H_r(nu_k)^2\n           = Phi_n(r).\n  (Direct from the definition of Phi_n and the indexing of the roots of r.)\n\nSTEP 3: Establish vector relations from the chain rule.\n\nClaim: u = h + alpha and v = h + beta (as vectors in R^n).\n\nProof: For each k = 1, ..., n, from Node 1.2(c):\n  H_r(nu_k) = H_p(lambda_{sigma(k)}) - alpha_k.\n\nRearranging:\n  H_p(lambda_{sigma(k)}) = H_r(nu_k) + alpha_k,\n  i.e., u_k = h_k + alpha_k.\n\nThis holds for all k, so as vectors: u = h + alpha. QED.\n\nSimilarly, from Node 1.2(c):\n  H_r(nu_k) = H_q(mu_{tau(k)}) - beta_k.\n\nRearranging:\n  H_q(mu_{tau(k)}) = H_r(nu_k) + beta_k,\n  i.e., v_k = h_k + beta_k.\n\nThis holds for all k, so as vectors: v = h + beta. QED.\n\nSTEP 4: Derive the compatibility relation.\n\nClaim: alpha - beta = u - v.\n\nProof: From Step 3:\n  u = h + alpha  =\u003e  alpha = u - h\n  v = h + beta   =\u003e  beta = v - h\n\nTherefore:\n  alpha - beta = (u - h) - (v - h) = u - h - v + h = u - v. QED.\n\nSUMMARY OF REFORMULATION:\n\nThe original conjecture 1/Phi_n(r) \u003e= 1/Phi_n(p) + 1/Phi_n(q) is now expressed in terms of vectors u, v, h, alpha, beta in R^n satisfying:\n  (R1) ||u||^2 = Phi_n(p),  ||v||^2 = Phi_n(q),  ||h||^2 = Phi_n(r).\n  (R2) u = h + alpha,  v = h + beta.\n  (R3) alpha - beta = u - v  (compatibility, follows from R2).\n\nThe target inequality becomes:\n  1/||h||^2 \u003e= 1/||u||^2 + 1/||v||^2.\n\nAll quantities are well-defined since p, q, r have simple roots, ensuring all H-values and hence all norms are nonzero.\n\nDEPENDENCIES: Node 1.1 (definitions), Node 1.2 (chain rule).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"cad4eb054d00d756e17790c1dc6944fd30104e94b7ed7a0c0861027869fa46a5","created":"2026-02-08T11:53:54.013504836Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
