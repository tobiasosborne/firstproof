The correct sigma is ORDER-PRESERVING (identity permutation on sorted roots), forced by omega_1 being a Herglotz function (maps upper half-plane to itself).\n\nCORRECTED RESULTS with order-preserving sigma (verify_sigma_corrected.py):\nFor n=2: \u003ch, alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 in ALL 800 trials (min = +4.01e-06). ALWAYS NON-NEGATIVE.\nFor n=3: \u003ch, alpha\u003e \u003c 0 in 3/300 trials (~1.0%), min = -9.97e-01.\nFor n=4: \u003ch, alpha\u003e \u003c 0 in 4/300 trials (~1.3%), min = -2.60e+00.\nFor n=5: \u003ch, alpha\u003e \u003c 0 in 2/300 trials (~0.7%), min = -2.07e+00.\nFor n=6: \u003ch, alpha\u003e \u003c 0 in 2/300 trials (~0.7%), min = -9.28e-01.\nAll n\u003e=3 negatives CONFIRMED by mpmath at 50-digit precision (not numerical artifacts).\n\nCOMPARISON with WRONG nearest-neighbor sigma:\nn=2: 15% negative with NN vs 0% with OP -- the old claim was COMPLETELY WRONG.\nn=3: 22% negative with NN vs 1% with OP -- massively inflated.\nn=4: 30% negative with NN vs 1.3% with OP -- massively inflated.\n\nCONCLUSION (revised):\n1. \u003ch, alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 ALWAYS holds for n=2 with correct order-preserving sigma.\n2. For n\u003e=3, \u003ch, alpha\u003e can be negative in ~1% of cases (confirmed by mpmath).\n3. The Cauchy-Schwarz approach \u003ch,u\u003e^2 \u003c= ||h||^2*||u||^2 is NOT invalidated for n=2.\n4. For n\u003e=3, the \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 property cannot be relied upon as a universal bound,\n   but the fraction of violations is small and the magnitude is modest compared to A.\n5. The old claim of \"ALL 1000 trials negative for n=2\" was entirely due to wrong sigma.\n\n=== HOWEVER: A \u003e 0 and B \u003e 0 ALWAYS ===\nA = Phi(p) - Phi(r) \u003e 0 in ALL trials, ALL values of n.\nB = Phi(q) - Phi(r) \u003e 0 in ALL trials, ALL values of n.\nThis confirms: Phi_n(p) \u003e Phi_n(r) = Phi_n(p boxplus_n q) always (Fisher info decreases under convolution).\nSince A = 2\u003ch,alpha\u003e + ||alpha||^2 and A \u003e 0, we get 2\u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e -||alpha||^2.\n\n=== HIGH-PRECISION CONFIRMATION ===\nCases that appeared as violations with 64-bit floats (nearly degenerate roots) were recomputed with mpmath (100-digit precision + Newton refinement). All confirmed: ratio \u003e= 1 and superadditivity excess \u003e= 0.\nExample: apparent n=4 violation (ratio=-0.001 with numpy) became ratio=1.172 with mpmath.\n\n=== EDGE CASES ===\nSymmetric p=q: Inequality holds with larger margin (min ratio ~1.0 for n=3, ~1.006 for n=4).\nNearly degenerate: Root-finding becomes ill-conditioned but inequality still holds (confirmed by mpmath).\nLarge n (6-8): Strong inequality, no violations.\n\n=== IMPLICATIONS FOR PROOF STRATEGY ===\n1. The reformulated inequality AB \u003e= Phi(r)^2 is CONFIRMED numerically.\n2. n=2 is an EQUALITY case (proved algebraically).\n3. n \u003e= 3 gives STRICT inequality.\n4. \u003ch, alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 holds ALWAYS for n=2, and in ~99% of cases for n\u003e=3. The prior claim that it was \"FALSE in general\" was based on wrong sigma. With correct sigma, it is false only in a small fraction of n\u003e=3 cases.\n5. A \u003e 0 and B \u003e 0 always hold (Fisher info decreases under convolution).\n6. The Cauchy-Schwarz approach in node 1.8 is NOT ruled out by \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 failures, but needs care for n\u003e=3.","owner":"corrector-agent"}
