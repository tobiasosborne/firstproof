Im(omega_1(z)) \u003c Im(z) possible, so phi=omega_1-id is not Herglotz; Nevanlinna representation gives phi'\u003e0 everywhere, contradicting phi'(nu_k)=0. APPROACH DEFINITIVELY BLOCKED. KEY NEW FINDINGS: (1) Cauchy matrix identity: \u003ch,alpha\u003e = sum_{k\u003cl} (h_k-h_l)(phi_k-phi_l)/[(nu_k-nu_l)(lambda_k-lambda_l)] with positive weights but mixed-sign numerators (92% positive, 8% negative). (2) \u003ch,alpha\u003e\u003e=0 fails 71% for random (non-MSS) pairs, confirming MSS structure essential. (3) F(t)=\u003ch_r,h_t\u003e along interpolation x(t)=(1-t)nu+t*lambda satisfies F(t)\u003e=F(0) (0/500 violations) -- this IS \u003ch,alpha\u003e\u003e=0. (4) Phi(t)=||h_t||^2 always monotone increasing (Schur-concavity + majorization gives weaker Phi_r\u003c=Phi_p). PROMISING DIRECTIONS: (A) Prove F(t)\u003e=F(0) via barrier argument at contact points. (B) Use Cauchy decomposition + MSS coefficient structure.
