The original Strategy 3 claimed omega_1'(nu_k) + omega_2'(nu_k) = 1. But the chain rule (node 1.2) proves omega_1'(nu_k) = omega_2'(nu_k) = 1, giving sum = 2, NOT 1. The original multiplicative chain rule H_r = H_p * omega_1' is also wrong; the correct relation is H_r = H_p - alpha (additive with second-order correction). Strategy 3 must be MODIFIED to account for these corrections.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"bd04d9595431b5749b6f47ff8243cde0920d2fb5af0ccfb7a152062e4a7711dd","created":"2026-02-08T11:51:22.21547899Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
