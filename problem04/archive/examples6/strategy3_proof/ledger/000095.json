For equally spaced roots (lambda_k = k*d_p, mu_k = k*d_q), the MSS convolution r = p boxplus_n q satisfies: At n=2: equality 1/Phi_r = 1/Phi_p + 1/Phi_q holds ALWAYS (all degree-2 polynomials are trivially equally spaced). At n=3: d_r^2 = d_p^2 + d_q^2 verified numerically to machine precision for equally spaced inputs. At n\u003e=4: roots of r are NOT equally spaced even when p,q are; strict inequality holds. Since Phi_n(p) = C_n/d^2 for equally spaced roots, the equality case corresponds to a Pythagorean identity d_r^2 = d_p^2 + d_q^2. This is a SPECIAL-CASE observation (n=2,3 only), not a general proof strategy. The equally-spaced characterization of equality only becomes meaningful at n\u003e=3 since n=2 is degenerate. VERIFIED: C_2=2, C_3=9/2, C_4=65/9, C_5~10.069. The interpretation as a finite free Cramer-Rao inequality is suggestive but does not yield a proof path for general (non-equally-spaced) inputs.","owner":"housekeep-agent"}
