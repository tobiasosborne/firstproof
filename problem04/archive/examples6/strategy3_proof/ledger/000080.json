Use that omega_1 is monotone increasing and satisfies omega_1'(nu_k)=1, so the \"correction\" omega_1(x) - x has specific sign properties between roots.\n2. Use the matrix model: \u003ch,u\u003e = sum_k H_r(nu_k)*H_p(lambda_k) can be related to a trace of a matrix product involving the resolvent.\n3. Use the implicit function F(z,w)=0 structure to derive a global identity.\n4. Observe that alpha_k = u_k - h_k = H_p(lambda_k) - H_r(nu_k), and this quantity relates to how the gap structure changes from r to p.","new_statement":"SUB-LEMMA: \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 is FALSE. DISPROVED by independent verification (agents a3557f4, a0f6a16). Counterexamples exist at n=4 with ~0.3-1% failure rate in random trials. Example: roots_p=[-2.957,-2.657,-0.975,0.015], roots_q=[-3.461,1.388,1.688,2.668] gives \u003ch,alpha\u003e=-0.192. TRUE only at n=2 (proved analytically). The main inequality AB \u003e= ||h||^4 STILL HOLDS despite this. Proof strategy must NOT rely on \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0.","owner":"orchestrator"}
