Equality holds:\n- Always at n=2 (proved analytically)\n- For equally spaced roots at n=3 (verified numerically to machine precision)\n- NEVER for non-equally-spaced roots at n\u003e=3 (strict inequality)\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: The inequality 1/Phi_r \u003e= 1/Phi_p + 1/Phi_q can be interpreted as: \"the squared effective gap of the free convolution is at least the sum of the squared effective gaps.\" This is a finite analogue of the free Cramer-Rao inequality.\n\nThe limiting case p -\u003e q gives AB/||h||^4 -\u003e 1 from above, confirming that equality is approached in the limit but not achieved (for n\u003e=3).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"dc10fc17056d793ec27d4d97d560ee1ee25dd18e38afaa1eb7900c5c5a69c20b","created":"2026-02-08T12:36:09.218526245Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
