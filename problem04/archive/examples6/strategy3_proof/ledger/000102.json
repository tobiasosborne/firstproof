Inductive approach via MSS derivative identity does NOT close directly, but reveals key structural facts:\n\n(1) CRITICAL BUG FIX: The boxplus formula used in prior scripts was WRONG for non-centered polynomials. The correct formula is g_k = sum_{i+j=k} C(n-j,i)/C(n,i) * e_i(p) * e_j(q) (verified against Monte Carlo). With the correct formula, the conjecture is CONFIRMED for n=2..6 (500+ trials each, zero violations).\n\n(2) n=2 BASE CASE: EXACT EQUALITY. gap_r^2 = gap_p^2 + gap_q^2 (Pythagorean). Proof: g_2 = e_2(p) + e_1(p)*e_1(q)/2 + e_2(q) gives discriminant = (a-b)^2 + (c-d)^2.\n\n(3) MSS DERIVATIVE IDENTITY: VERIFIED TO MACHINE PRECISION with correct boxplus. r'(x) = n * (p^{(1)} boxplus_{n-1} q^{(1)})(x).\n\n(4) DECOMPOSITION: F_n = F_{n-1} + (delta_r - delta_p - delta_q) is exact. But delta_r - delta_p - delta_q is NOT always \u003e= 0 (fails ~40% of trials for n=4,5). So direct delta-superadditivity induction FAILS.\n\n(5) KEY POSITIVE FINDING: F_n/F_{n-1} \u003e 0 in ALL tested cases (n=4,5). This ratio ranges from 0.25 to 218000. If one could prove this ratio is positive, induction closes. But proving this seems as hard as the original conjecture.\n\n(6) Phi_n/Phi_{n-1} ratio is NOT constant (varies with root config). No clean formula found.\n\nCONCLUSION: The inductive approach does not close. The most promising lead is the n=3 direct proof (equality when uniform spacing preserved) or a simultaneous-level argument using the convolution telescoping structure.\n\nSee: investigate_induction_v4.py (correct boxplus), debug_boxplus_v2.py (formula verification), findings_induction.md (detailed writeup).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"b65e6befe9c543f3e96a79c03d998db7e4993116b6c04ac55dce0373ef71e508","created":"2026-02-08T14:05:12.720684949Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
