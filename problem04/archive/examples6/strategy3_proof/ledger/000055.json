A = Phi_p - Phi_r \u003e 0: TRUE always (roots of r are MORE SPREAD than roots of p).\n   B = Phi_q - Phi_r \u003e 0: TRUE always.\n\n4. AB \u003e= ||h||^4: TRUE in 100% of trials.\n   - Equality at n=2: AB/||h||^4 = 1 exactly (proved analytically).\n   - For n\u003e=3: strict inequality, AB/||h||^4 \u003e 1.\n   - As p -\u003e q: AB/||h||^4 -\u003e 1 (the tight case).\n   - Minimum found: AB/||h||^4 ~ 1.007 at n=3.\n\n5. The angle cos(h,alpha) ranges from 0.09 to 1.0:\n   - NOT parallel in general (unlike n=2 where cos=1 always).\n   - Component-wise h_k*alpha_k can have mixed signs (60% of cases for n\u003e=3).\n   - But the INNER PRODUCT \u003ch,alpha\u003e = sum h_k*alpha_k is always nonneg.\n\n=== ANALYTICAL RESULTS ===\n\nFor n=2 (EXACT PROOF):\n  - r = p boxplus_2 q has gap_r = sqrt(gap_p^2 + gap_q^2)\n  - Phi_n = 2/gap^2, so Phi_r = 2/(gap_p^2 + gap_q^2)\n  - A = 2*gap_q^2/(gap_p^2*(gap_p^2+gap_q^2)), B = 2*gap_p^2/(gap_q^2*(gap_p^2+gap_q^2))\n  - AB = 4/(gap_p^2+gap_q^2)^2 = Phi_r^2 = ||h||^4 EXACTLY.\n  - \u003ch,alpha\u003e = 2(R-s)/(R^2*s) \u003e 0 since R = sqrt(s^2+t^2) \u003e s.\n\n=== WHAT IS NEEDED FOR A PROOF ===\n\nThe key sub-lemma needed is: \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 (equivalently \u003ch,u\u003e \u003e= ||h||^2).\n\nThis means: sum_k H_r(nu_k) * H_p(lambda_k) \u003e= sum_k H_r(nu_k)^2\n\nwhere lambda_k = omega_1(nu_k), omega_1 is the subordination function satisfying:\n  G_r(z) = G_p(omega_1(z)), omega_1'(nu_k) = 1, omega_1 maps C+ to C+.\n\nPOTENTIAL PROOF APPROACHES for \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0:\n\nA) HERGLOTZ CONVEXITY: omega_1 maps C+ to C+ and is a rational function.\n   The second derivative omega_1''(nu_k) relates to the \"curvature\" of omega_1\n   at the roots of r. The sign of \u003ch,alpha\u003e might follow from a global convexity\n   argument combined with the constraint omega_1'(nu_k) = 1.\n\nB) MATRIX MODEL: Since r = E_U[chi_{A+UBU*}] and omega_1 arises from the\n   resolvent identity, the positivity of \u003ch,alpha\u003e may follow from a matrix\n   trace inequality involving the Hessian of the log-determinant.\n\nC) CAUCHY-SCHWARZ STRENGTHENING (for the FULL inequality AB \u003e= ||h||^4):\n   Even assuming \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0, we cannot close AB \u003e= ||h||^4 just from this.\n   The sub-lemma 4*\u003ch,alpha\u003e*\u003ch,beta\u003e \u003e= ||h||^4 FAILS in ~16% of cases.\n   The full product (2\u003ch,alpha\u003e + ||alpha||^2)(2\u003ch,beta\u003e + ||beta||^2) \u003e= ||h||^4\n   requires using BOTH the inner product terms AND the norm-squared terms.\n\n   The \"parallel component\" approach: writing alpha = s_a*(h/||h||) + alpha_perp,\n   the product s_a(2+s_a)*s_b(2+s_b) \u003e= 1 in 499/500 cases (near-sufficient).\n   Adding the perpendicular terms t_a^2, t_b^2 closes the gap.\n\nD) DIRECT ALGEBRAIC: For the MSS convolution specifically, there may be a closed-form\n   identity expressing AB - ||h||^4 in terms of the polynomial coefficients.\n\n=== STATUS ===\n- \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 is a TRUE and NEEDED sub-lemma (no proof yet, but strong numerical evidence)\n- \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 alone is NOT sufficient for AB \u003e= ||h||^4\n- The full inequality AB \u003e= ||h||^4 requires combining \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 with norm bounds\n- Equality at n=2 proved analytically; strict inequality for n\u003e=3 with minimum at p -\u003e q limit","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"f9115e4602fd0e817fdd9ef5550b351713665909e77dafd8d0d9453260989be4","created":"2026-02-08T12:33:17.764699889Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
