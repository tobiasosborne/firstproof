Therefore:\n  omega_1'(nu_k) + omega_2'(nu_k) = 1 + 1 = 2 ≠ 1.\nThe partition of unity as originally stated is false. QED.\n\nCLAIM 2: The original multiplicative chain rule \"H_r(nu_k) = H_p(lambda_{sigma(k)}) * omega_1'(nu_k)\" is WRONG.\n\nProof: Suppose for contradiction that the multiplicative relation held:\n  H_r(nu_k) = H_p(lambda_{sigma(k)}) * omega_1'(nu_k).\nBy Node 1.2(b), omega_1'(nu_k) = 1, so this would give:\n  H_r(nu_k) = H_p(lambda_{sigma(k)}).\nBut the correct relation from Node 1.2(c) is:\n  H_r(nu_k) = H_p(lambda_{sigma(k)}) - alpha_k,\nwhere alpha_k = omega_1''(nu_k)/2 is generically nonzero (it is the second-order correction from the subordination function). The multiplicative relation omits this correction term. QED.\n\nCLAIM 3: The correct relation is ADDITIVE with second-order correction.\n\nStatement: The correct chain rule at the roots of r is:\n  H_r(nu_k) = H_p(lambda_{sigma(k)}) - alpha_k    (from omega_1)\n  H_r(nu_k) = H_q(mu_{tau(k)}) - beta_k            (from omega_2)\nwhere alpha_k = omega_1''(nu_k)/2 and beta_k = omega_2''(nu_k)/2 are second-order corrections arising from the Taylor expansion of the subordination functions at the roots.\n\nThis is a direct restatement of Node 1.2(c). The relation is additive (subtraction), not multiplicative. The corrections alpha_k, beta_k capture the curvature of the subordination functions.\n\nCONSEQUENCE: Strategy 3 must be modified. The original strategy assumed omega_1' and omega_2' form a partition of unity summing to 1, which enabled a direct application of Cauchy-Schwarz. Since the derivatives are both equal to 1 (summing to 2), the original Cauchy-Schwarz argument does not apply as stated. The modified strategy proceeds through the vector reformulation (Node 1.4) and clean reformulation (Node 1.5), working with the additive correction terms alpha, beta directly.\n\nDEPENDENCIES: Node 1.2 (admitted chain rule).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"14990d8ff35e585ea71afd281b969c83a6423f0062ec73135744401d833125d3","created":"2026-02-08T11:53:19.039031466Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
