The minimum observed was \u003ch,alpha\u003e = -1.19.\n\nConcrete counterexample (n=4):\n  roots_p = [-2.957, -2.657, -0.975, 0.015]\n  roots_q = [-3.461, 1.388, 1.688, 2.668]\n  roots_r (exact MSS) = [-5.362, -1.035, 0.317, 1.788]\n  \u003ch,alpha\u003e = -0.192 (verified with MC at 1k, 5k, 50k samples)\n\nImplications:\n1. The sub-lemma \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 is FALSE, not merely unproven.\n2. All four proof approaches (A-D) pursue a FALSE statement.\n3. The STATUS section claim 'this is a TRUE and NEEDED sub-lemma' is WRONG.\n4. The parallel component bound s_a(2+s_a)*s_b(2+s_b) \u003e= 1 fails in ~1% of cases (50/5000).\n\nHowever, the MAIN inequality 1/Phi_r \u003e= 1/Phi_p + 1/Phi_q STILL HOLDS (0 violations in 5000 MSS tests). The proof strategy needs revision.\n\nThe n=2 exact algebra is VERIFIED CORRECT.\n\nScripts: verify_claims_171_173_final.py","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
