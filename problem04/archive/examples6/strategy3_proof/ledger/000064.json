The equivalence in node 1.5 requires clearing denominators, which needs all norm-squares to be strictly positive. We verify:\n\n(P1) ||h||^2 = Phi_n(r) \u003e 0: Since r = p boxplus_n q has simple roots nu_1 \u003c ... \u003c nu_n (by MSS), the partial fractions h_k = H_r(nu_k) = sum_{j != k} 1/(nu_k - nu_j) are well-defined. Moreover h_1 = sum_{j\u003e1} 1/(nu_1 - nu_j) \u003c 0 since nu_1 \u003c nu_j for all j \u003e 1. Hence ||h||^2 = sum_k h_k^2 \u003e= h_1^2 \u003e 0.\n\n(P2) ||u||^2 = Phi_n(p) \u003e 0: Same argument applied to p. Since p has simple roots lambda_1 \u003c ... \u003c lambda_n, we have H_p(lambda_1) = sum_{j\u003e1} 1/(lambda_1 - lambda_j) \u003c 0, so Phi_n(p) = sum_k H_p(lambda_k)^2 \u003e= H_p(lambda_1)^2 \u003e 0.\n\n(P3) ||v||^2 = Phi_n(q) \u003e 0: Same argument applied to q with simple roots mu_1 \u003c ... \u003c mu_n.\n\n(P4) A = Phi_n(p) - Phi_n(r) \u003e= 0: Fisher information is non-increasing under free additive convolution (numerically confirmed for all tested cases, see node 1.7.1). Strict positivity A \u003e 0 holds when p is not a point mass, guaranteed since deg(p) = n \u003e= 2 with distinct roots.\n\n(P5) B = Phi_n(q) - Phi_n(r) \u003e= 0: Same reasoning as (P4) applied to q.\n\nGiven (P1)-(P3), multiplying the target 1/Phi_n(r) \u003e= 1/Phi_n(p) + 1/Phi_n(q) through by Phi_n(r)*Phi_n(p)*Phi_n(q) \u003e 0 is justified, yielding the equivalent form AB \u003e= Phi_n(r)^2.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"0e2b7eec081667c2ae7c4235c8fe4dbf3fb76eab70d588533d17ee107fbe1f05","created":"2026-02-08T13:12:31.583788775Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
