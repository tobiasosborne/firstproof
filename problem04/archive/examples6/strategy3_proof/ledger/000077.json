The node says this is the 'equality case of the Fisher inequality.' But at n=2, the Fisher inequality is ALWAYS an equality (for ALL inputs, not just equally spaced ones). This is because at n=2 every polynomial has only 2 roots, and is 'equally spaced' by definition. The node should clarify that n=2 is trivial/degenerate.\n\nISSUE 2: The claim 'For equally spaced roots, d_r^2 = d_p^2 + d_q^2' is verified for n=2 and n=3, which is correct. But the logical structure is confusing: since ALL n=2 cases have equality (not just equally spaced), the equally-spaced characterization of equality only becomes meaningful at n \u003e= 3.\n\nISSUE 3: The claim that d_r^2 = d_p^2 + d_q^2 for equally spaced roots at n=3 is VERIFIED (numerically to machine precision). This is a legitimate finding. However, calling it 'CRITICAL DISCOVERY' and 'Pythagorean identity' overstates its significance since: (a) it only works at n=2,3, (b) at n\u003e=4 it breaks, and (c) it provides no path toward proving the inequality for general (non-equally-spaced) roots.\n\nVERIFIED CLAIMS:\n- Phi_n(p) = C_n/d^2 for equally spaced roots: CORRECT\n  C_2 = 2, C_3 = 9/2, C_4 = 65/9, C_5 ~ 10.069\n- d_r^2 = d_p^2 + d_q^2 for equally spaced at n=2,3: CORRECT\n- Not equally spaced at n\u003e=4: CORRECT\n- The Pythagorean interpretation is suggestive but not a rigorous proof strategy\n\nScripts: verify_claims_171_173_final.py","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
