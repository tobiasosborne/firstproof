The key inequality AB \u003e= ||h||^4 remains unproved. Moreover, the counterexample h=(1,0), alpha=(10,0), beta=(0,0) shows AB = 120*0 = 0 \u003c 1 = ||h||^4 for arbitrary vectors, so structural properties of alpha, beta from subordination are ESSENTIAL and have not been identified. This QED cannot be accepted until the gap between AB \u003e= 0 and AB \u003e= ||h||^4 is closed.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
