Step 3 is direct rearrangement of the chain rule. Step 4 is trivial algebra. The reformulation is clean and well-presented. Minor note: the claim that 'all norms are nonzero' is correct but could note that individual components may be zero -- only the norms are guaranteed positive (via H_p(lambda_1) \u003c 0). Numerically verified u = h + alpha and v = h + beta at n=2,3 with multiple polynomial pairs."}
