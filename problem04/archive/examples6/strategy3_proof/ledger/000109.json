They were computed using the WRONG boxplus formula (simple additive cumulants: hat_e_k(r) = sum hat_e_j(p)*hat_e_{k-j}(q)). The correct MSS formula c_k = sum_{i+j=k} [(n-i)\\!(n-j)\\!/(n\\!(n-k)\\!)] a_i b_j gives: p=q={-5,-1,1,5}: gap=+0.489 (HOLDS), p=q={-3,-1,1,3}: gap=+0.00255 (HOLDS). Verified against Monte Carlo (1M Haar unitaries for the close case). The node's claim that the conjecture is FALSE for n\u003e=4 is WRONG. With the correct formula, 2500 random trials across n=2..6 show zero violations. See verify_boxplus_definitive.py and verify_boxplus_highprec.py.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
