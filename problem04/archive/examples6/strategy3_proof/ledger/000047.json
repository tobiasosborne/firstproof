Part I: both directions of the equivalence verified step by step -- algebra is correct, and the positivity hypothesis H,U,V \u003e 0 is explicitly stated (resolving the minor gap noted in parent 1.5). Part II: n=2 equality verified symbolically. Step A correctly computes H_p(a) = 1/(a-b), matching both the p''/2p' formula and the sum definition. Step C correctly derives the MSS discriminant D = (b-a)^2 + (d-c)^2. Steps D and E confirm equality. The remark about A = 2\u003ch,alpha\u003e + ||alpha||^2 is correct from the Pythagorean expansion. All independently verified with symbolic computation."}
