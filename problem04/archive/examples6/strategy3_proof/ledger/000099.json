COUNTEREXAMPLE (n=4, centered): p={-5,-1,1,5}, q={-5,-1,1,5}, gap=-0.449. The free probability motivation (Voiculescu's exact additivity 1/Phi*(mu boxplus nu) = 1/Phi*(mu) + 1/Phi*(nu)) holds only in the n-\u003einfinity limit. At finite n: (a) n=2 centered gives exact equality (trivial), (b) n=3 centered gives superadditivity (PROVED for symmetric, numerically verified for asymmetric), (c) n\u003e=4 centered gives COUNTEREXAMPLES. Matrix formulation: Phi_n = ||C@1||^2 where C is the antisymmetric off-diagonal Cauchy matrix. Jensen approach via r = E_U[chi_{A+UBU*}] does not close because E_U[Phi_n(A+UBU*)] \\!= Phi_n(A) + Phi_n(B).
