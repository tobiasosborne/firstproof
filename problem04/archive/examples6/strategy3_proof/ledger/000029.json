Claim 2: valid refutation -- if multiplicative form held with omega_1'=1, then H_r=H_p, contradicting the additive form with generically nonzero alpha_k (confirmed numerically). Claim 3: direct restatement of 1.2(c). Note: node should declare dependency on 1.2 but this is a minor bookkeeping issue. The missing dependency declaration does not affect correctness since Node 1.2 is admitted."}
