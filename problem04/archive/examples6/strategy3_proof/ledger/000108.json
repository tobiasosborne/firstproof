Agent B (matrix-prover) used the WRONG boxplus formula. Agent B used simple additive finite free cumulants: hat_e_k(r) = sum hat_e_j(p) * hat_e_{k-j}(q) where hat_e_k = e_k/C(n,k). This is NOT the MSS finite free convolution. The CORRECT formula (Definition 0.2 of the source doc, verified against Monte Carlo with 100K+ Haar unitaries) is: c_k = sum_{i+j=k} [(n-i)!(n-j)!/(n!(n-k)!)] a_i b_j, equivalently g_k = sum_{i+j=k} [C(n-j,i)/C(n,i)] e_i e_j. For the alleged counterexample p=q={-5,-1,1,5} at n=4: Correct formula gives gap=+0.489 (conjecture HOLDS), Agent B formula gives gap=-0.449 (violated), Monte Carlo gives gap=+0.493 (matches correct formula). Large-scale test: 2500 trials across n=2..6 with ZERO violations using correct formula. See verify_boxplus_definitive.py.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
