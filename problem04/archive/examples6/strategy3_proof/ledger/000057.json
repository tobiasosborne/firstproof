Use that omega_1 is monotone increasing and satisfies omega_1'(nu_k)=1, so the \"correction\" omega_1(x) - x has specific sign properties between roots.\n2. Use the matrix model: \u003ch,u\u003e = sum_k H_r(nu_k)*H_p(lambda_k) can be related to a trace of a matrix product involving the resolvent.\n3. Use the implicit function F(z,w)=0 structure to derive a global identity.\n4. Observe that alpha_k = u_k - h_k = H_p(lambda_k) - H_r(nu_k), and this quantity relates to how the gap structure changes from r to p.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"d7ad40469f52e5e9c4d400130e68539bab8caeec9460bebb472739097c63d890","created":"2026-02-08T12:35:56.180344575Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
