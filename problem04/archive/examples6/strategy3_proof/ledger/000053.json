This uses an incorrect bijection sigma. The correct sigma is determined by the Herglotz property of omega_1 (maps C^+ to C^+), which forces sigma to be ORDER-PRESERVING. With the correct order-preserving sigma: (1) At n=2, \u003ch,alpha\u003e = 2*(sqrt(D)-s)/(s*D) \u003e 0 ALWAYS (proved symbolically, where s=(b-a)/2, D=s^2+t^2). (2) At n=2,3,4 with correct Herglotz sigma, \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e 0 in ALL tested trials (0 negatives out of 70+ trials). The incorrect sigma was likely found by a nearest-neighbor matching algorithm that does not respect the Herglotz constraint. CONSEQUENCE: The conclusion that 'the Cauchy-Schwarz approach in node 1.8 needs a different structural property' may be PREMATURE. If \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 always holds (with correct sigma), then node 1.8's approach ||h||^4 \u003c= \u003ch,u\u003e^2 \u003c= Phi_r*Phi_p IS valid. This does not close the proof (node 1.8 acknowledges this only gives AB \u003e= 0, not AB \u003e= ||h||^4), but it removes a false obstacle.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
