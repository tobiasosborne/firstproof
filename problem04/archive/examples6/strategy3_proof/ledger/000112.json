A + B \u003e= 2*Phi_r holds numerically (zero counterexamples in 6000+ trials across n=2..6, both MSS and Marcus formulas agree) and is proved analytically for n=2 (via (gap_p^2 - gap_q^2)^2 \u003e= 0) and for n=3 equally spaced. The infimum of (A+B)/(2*Phi_r) is exactly 1, achieved when p=q with equal spacing. HOWEVER, the AM-GM step in the proposed proof chain is WRONG: AM-GM gives AB \u003c= ((A+B)/2)^2 (upper bound), NOT AB \u003e= ((A+B)/2)^2. So A+B \u003e= 2*Phi_r does NOT imply AB \u003e= Phi_r^2. The sum inequality (C1: Phi_p + Phi_q \u003e= 4*Phi_r) and product inequality (C2: Phi_p*Phi_q \u003e= Phi_r*(Phi_p+Phi_q), equivalent to Fisher superadditivity) are logically independent. Both hold numerically but neither implies the other. Direct proof of Fisher superadditivity required.
