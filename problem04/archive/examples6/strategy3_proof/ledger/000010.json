From u = h + alpha: A = 2\u003ch,alpha\u003e + ||alpha||^2. From v = h + beta: B = 2\u003ch,beta\u003e + ||beta||^2. Target: AB \u003e= ||h||^4. Investigate what structural properties of (alpha, beta) -- arising from the algebraic subordination equation F(z,w) = r'(z)p(w) - p'(w)r(z) = 0 -- guarantee this inequality. Key question: is \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0 always? If so, A \u003e= ||alpha||^2 and the proof may close via AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"b3bbbb32b45357820152e16079fac918ec8720e3e2adab62d9c29884788dc8d2","created":"2026-02-08T11:51:22.215496641Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
