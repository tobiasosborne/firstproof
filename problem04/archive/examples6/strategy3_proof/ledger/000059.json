Here p^{(1)} = (1/n)*p' is the monic polynomial whose roots are the critical points of p.\n\nThis means the critical points of r are EXACTLY the roots of p^{(1)} boxplus_{n-1} q^{(1)}.\n\nPROPOSED INDUCTIVE ARGUMENT:\nBase case: n=2 is proved (equality holds).\nInductive step: Assume 1/Phi_{n-1}(s) \u003e= 1/Phi_{n-1}(s_1) + 1/Phi_{n-1}(s_2) for all s = s_1 boxplus_{n-1} s_2. Show 1/Phi_n(r) \u003e= 1/Phi_n(p) + 1/Phi_n(q) for r = p boxplus_n q.\n\nOBSTACLE: The ratio Phi_n(p)/Phi_{n-1}(p^{(1)}) is NOT constant (varies from ~1.6 to ~6 depending on the root configuration). Therefore, a simple \"multiply both sides by the same constant\" argument fails.\n\nHOWEVER: The inequality ineq_n = 1/Phi_n(r) - 1/Phi_n(p) - 1/Phi_n(q) is always positive when ineq_{n-1} is positive (verified in all 20 test cases). The magnitudes are comparable, suggesting a possible relationship.\n\nWHAT IS NEEDED: A formula or inequality relating Phi_n(p) to Phi_{n-1}(p^{(1)}) and the interlacing structure. If we could show:\n  Phi_n(p) \u003c= f(Phi_{n-1}(p^{(1)}), root gaps)\nfor some function f that respects the inductive hypothesis, the proof could close.\n\nALTERNATIVE: Instead of induction on n, use the derivative identity to relate the subordination functions at degree n to those at degree n-1, inheriting the structural properties (like \u003ch,alpha\u003e \u003e= 0).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"3c88fbed37741a4ea30800586103b5adcc129a8a53e1c678092e5562908d1b84","created":"2026-02-08T12:36:24.882420375Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
