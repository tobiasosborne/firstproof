All claims verified to machine precision (relative error \u003c 10^{-14}):\n- Phi_n * disc = N_n for n=2,3,4 with the stated formulas.\n- N_n is a homogeneous polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials.\n- For n=2: Phi_2*disc = 2 (constant).\n- For n=3: Phi_3*disc = 18*e_2^2 (verified 5 trials, exact ratio 1.0).\n- For n=4: Phi_4*disc = -8*e_2^5 - 36*e_2^2*e_3^2 - 64*e_2^3*e_4 - 432*e_3^2*e_4 + 384*e_2*e_4^2 (verified 10 trials, relative error \u003c 3e-15).\n\nThis node is solid and contains the key structural identity needed for the cumulant approach.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
