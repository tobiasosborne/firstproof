Verified for n=2,3,4,5: C_2=1, C_3=2/9, C_4=1/12, C_5=1/25. The correct formula is C_n = 4/(n^2*(n-1)). Equivalently C_n = (2/n) / C(n,2). While C_4=1/12 happens to be correct (4/(16*3)=1/12), the general formula C_n=2/(n(n-1)) gives C_3=1/3 instead of 2/9 and C_5=1/10 instead of 1/25. The specific R_4 formula and C_4=1/12 value are confirmed correct; only the general C_n conjecture is wrong.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
