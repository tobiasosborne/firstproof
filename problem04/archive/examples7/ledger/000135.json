Denominator factors as 24*(4*k2^2-k4)*(4*k2^3+k2*k4-2*k3^2), both factors positive on domain. R_4 has cumulant weight 2. For k3=0: R_4=-k4^2/(24*k2*(4*k2^2-k4)), gap denominator factors into positive terms. Quadratic part of gap numerator is positive-definite (det=768*s^4*t^4*(s+t)^4). Joint concavity of -R_4 FAILS. Full proof not achieved; reduces to polynomial non-negativity.
