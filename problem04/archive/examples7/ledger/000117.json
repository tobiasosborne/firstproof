Numerical investigation (VERIFIER-7) shows that 1/Phi_n(p box sigma_t) is CONCAVE and monotonically increasing in t (verified for n=3,4,5 across multiple starting polynomials with zero exceptions). This is the finite free analog of the concavity property used in Costa's proof of the classical entropy power inequality (EPI). Combined with the exact scaling property Phi_n(D_c(p)) = Phi_n(p)/c^2 (which perfectly mirrors the classical Fisher information scaling I(cX) = I(X)/c^2) and the commutativity of dilation with MSS convolution (D_c(p box q) = D_c(p) box D_c(q), which follows from kappa_k(D_c p) = c^k kappa_k(p)), there exists a complete finite free information-theoretic framework that the proof tree does not mention. While making this approach rigorous faces its own obstacles -- specifically (a) constructing the proper finite free semicircular semigroup sigma_t with ALL kappa_k = 0 for k \u003e= 3 (the naive choice x^n - t*x^{n-2} does NOT have kappa_k = 0 for k \u003e= 3 and fails the semigroup property), and (b) the potential circularity where the heat flow argument may ultimately require the inequality at all noise levels -- this direction is sufficiently promising to warrant explicit mention as a fifth gap (G5) in node 1.5.3.5.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
