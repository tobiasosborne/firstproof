Define the resolvent-based quantity: for fixed z in C\\R, let g(U) = (1/n) tr((zI - A - UBU*)^{-1}). Then E[g(U)] is related to but NOT equal to G_r(z) = (1/n) d/dz log r(z) (the logarithmic derivative of the expectation vs the expectation of the logarithmic derivative differ by Jensen). However, the MSS formula gives an EXACT polynomial identity, not just an expectation.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"4cdd5d11d3bb31fbd3056a376091d73dc338392c6e73c766dbc053a940524b6f","created":"2026-02-08T12:05:39.20992499Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
