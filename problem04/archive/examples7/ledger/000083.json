The original formulation suggested using cumulant additivity from Step 1.5.2 to bound ||H_r||^2 via Cauchy-Schwarz. FINDING: A direct Cauchy-Schwarz argument on the vectors H_p, H_q, H_r is NOT possible because these vectors live in different R^n spaces (indexed by different root sets mu_i, nu_j, lambda_i). No canonical inner product between H_p and H_r exists without additional structure.\n\nThree approaches were analyzed:\n(A) SUBORDINATION APPROACH (conditional): If subordination functions exist, they provide bijections between root sets, lifting all vectors into a common R^n. The inequality then reduces to ||h||^2/||h+alpha||^2 + ||h||^2/||h+beta||^2 \u003c= 1, which requires resolving Hard Lemma 2 (correction vector bounds). See nodes 1.5.3.2, 1.5.3.3.\n(B) CAUCHY MATRIX APPROACH: Using H_r(lambda_i) = (1/2) sum_k 1/(lambda_i - gamma_k), one can bound Phi_n(r) via the Cauchy matrix C_{ik} = 1/(lambda_i - gamma_k), but the resulting bounds do not involve Phi_n(p) and Phi_n(q) in the right way. See node 1.5.3.4.\n(C) CUMULANT APPROACH (blocked): Phi_n is not convex in the finite free cumulants (verified for n=2), so cumulant additivity alone cannot yield the inequality.\n\nCONCLUSION: The Cauchy-Schwarz step as originally conceived (via cumulants) does not work. The proof requires either subordination (unproved at finite n) or an entirely new approach. See node 1.5.3.5 for the complete honest assessment.","owner":"prover-5"}
