Show that proportionality H_p(mu_i)/H_q(nu_i) = const for all i forces p and q to have identical gap ratios, which generically fails, giving strict inequality 1/Phi_n(r) \u003e 1/Phi_n(p) + 1/Phi_n(q) for n \u003e= 3.","new_statement":"STRICTNESS CHARACTERIZATION FOR 1/Phi_n SUPERADDITIVITY:\n\nComplete analysis of when equality vs strict inequality holds in 1/Phi_n(p ⊞_n q) \u003e= 1/Phi_n(p) + 1/Phi_n(q).\n\n(a) n = 1: Trivial/vacuous (Phi_1 undefined for degree-1 polynomials).\n\n(b) n = 2: EQUALITY ALWAYS HOLDS (unconditionally proved).

Equal-gap is the unique gap structure preserved by MSS convolution at n=3. Analytical proof provided. See child 1.5.4.2.\n\n(d) n \u003e= 4: STRICT INEQUALITY FOR ALL PAIRS. MSS convolution does not preserve equal-gap structure for n \u003e= 4, so even the most symmetric pairs give strict inequality. Numerical evidence provided. See child 1.5.4.3.\n\nCORRECTION: The original node statement (strict for all n \u003e= 3) was incorrect. The n=3 equal-gap family gives exact equality.","owner":"prover-6"}
