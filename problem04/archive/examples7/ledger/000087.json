The equation r''/r - (r'/r)^2 = -sum 1/(x-lambda_i)^2 has singularities on both sides as x -\u003e lambda_i, and extracting the identity from 'dominant terms' requires careful Laurent expansion analysis that is not provided. A cleaner argument: factor r(x) = (x-lambda_i)*Q_i(x), then r'(lambda_i) = Q_i(lambda_i) and r''(lambda_i) = 2*Q_i'(lambda_i), giving r''/(2r') = Q_i'/Q_i = sum_{j\\!=i} 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j). The mathematical conclusion is correct, but the reasoning path should be tightened.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
