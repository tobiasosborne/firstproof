F_r'(lambda_i)=n computation confirmed algebraically and numerically. The 'different R^n spaces' obstacle is genuine (analogous to classical Stam but lacking the conditional expectation mechanism). Subordination is correctly identified as the finite free analog of conditional expectation. Three alternative approaches independently investigated and confirmed as blocked: (1) random matrix Jensen (Phi_n convex, wrong direction; deterministic inequality false with 142/10000 violations), (2) log-energy/discriminant (neither super- nor sub-additive, ~570-650/1000 violations), (3) ALOV19 (coefficient log-concavity unrelated to root spacing). The assessment 'conjecture open, no proof found' is honest and accurate. One partially overlooked approach noted (Costa/heat flow -- see challenge ch-6dfe2174164a1852): 1/Phi_n is concave along semicircular flow, paralleling the classical EPI proof, but rigorous development faces semigroup construction and circularity obstacles."}
