R_n \u003c= 0 in ALL observations (R_n penalizes non-Gaussianity). R_n superadditivity: 0 violations across 10,000+ trials for n=3,4,5,6. R_3 = -(1/6)*K3^2/K2^2 proved superadditive via Cauchy-Schwarz. R_4 exact rational formula: (-54K2^3K3^2 + 6K2^2K4^2 - 45K2K3^2K4 + 27K3^4 - K4^3) / (9(6K2^2+K4)(6K2^3-K2K4+3K3^2)). Cumulant additivity verified for kappa_2,...,kappa_6.
