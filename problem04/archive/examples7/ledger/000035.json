So Phi_2(p) = 1/(a-b)^2 + 1/(b-a)^2 = 2/(a-b)^2. Similarly for q with roots c \u003c d: Phi_2(q) = 2/(c-d)^2. The reciprocals are 1/Phi_2(p) = (a-b)^2/2 and 1/Phi_2(q) = (c-d)^2/2.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"5162208df053775c6b274b6dfd5f4c807365c02c7f86d4a7d3a60e25c5f233dc","created":"2026-02-08T12:07:58.244767975Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
