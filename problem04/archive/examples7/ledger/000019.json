Using the cumulant additivity from Step 1.5.2 and the expression for H_r in terms of cumulants, show that ||H_r||^2 can be bounded above by a function of ||H_p||^2 = Phi_n(p) and ||H_q||^2 = Phi_n(q) via the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, establishing Phi_n(r) \u003c= Phi_n(p)*Phi_n(q)/(Phi_n(p)+Phi_n(q)).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"812c39adaa8eb9649eb58ecc8df65feb54d06471583cefc85ebdc137c32c2519","created":"2026-02-08T12:05:39.20993042Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
