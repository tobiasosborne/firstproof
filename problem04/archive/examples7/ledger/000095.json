{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-08T12:26:07.142972282Z","node_id":"1.4","note":"KEY LEMMA verified. All six child nodes (1.4.1-1.4.6) accepted. Mathematics is correct throughout. Three minor challenges and one note filed for expository improvements (simplicity proof gap, inference type, imprecise argument, missing dependencies). No critical or major issues found. Verified numerically with multiple polynomial examples (n=2,3 MSS convolutions and explicit root examples) and theoretically (logarithmic derivative proof for simplicity, factorization proof for H_r identity)."}
