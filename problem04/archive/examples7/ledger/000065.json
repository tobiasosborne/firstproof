This is non-standard -- 0/0 is undefined even in extended reals. The harmonic-mean equivalence (from node 1.1) requires Phi \u003e 0, so it simply does not apply for n=1. The node should not invoke this alternative form at all. However, the PRIMARY argument via 1/0 = +infinity in extended reals [0,+infinity] is correct, so this is only a minor expositional issue.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
