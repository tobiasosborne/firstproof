Math.). Proof strategy: (1) For r = p boxplus_n q, define finite subordination functions omega_p, omega_q such that G_r(z) = G_p(omega_q(z)) = G_q(omega_p(z)) with omega_p(z) + omega_q(z) - z = F(z) for some correction. (2) Express H_r(rho_i) in terms of H_p, H_q evaluated at subordinated points. (3) Prove L^2 contraction: sum_i H_r(rho_i)^2 \u003c= weighted combination of sum H_p^2 and sum H_q^2, using MSS interlacing.
