Core algebra is correct. Minor challenge filed: node does not explicitly state positivity precondition (Phi_n \u003e 0 for n \u003e= 2). For n \u003e= 2, Phi_n(p) \u003e 0 is guaranteed since p'' has degree n-2 and cannot vanish at all n simple roots. The n=1 case (Phi_1=0) is handled separately in sibling node 1.2. No critical or major issues found."}
