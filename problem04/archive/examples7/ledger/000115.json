For general n, equal-gap polynomials p(x) = prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - ks) have H_p proportional to a FIXED direction (independent of s). For n=4: H proportional to (-11, -3, 3, 11). So Phi_n(p) scales as C_n/s^2 for a constant C_n depending only on n.\n\nStep 2. However, MSS convolution does NOT preserve equal-gap structure for n \u003e= 4. Numerically verified for n=4:\n  - p with gaps (1,1,1), q with gaps (1,1,1): r has gaps (1.4339, 1.3846, 1.4339) — NOT equal.\n  - The gap ratios 1.036 and 0.966 deviate from 1.0.\n  This is a fundamental structural difference from n=3 (where equal-gap IS preserved).\n\nStep 3. Since equal-gap is not preserved, H_r is NOT proportional to H_p even when H_p || H_q. The \"equality condition\" (H vectors proportional) is never simultaneously satisfied by p, q, AND r when n \u003e= 4.\n\nStep 4. Numerical verification:\n  n=4: p roots {0,1,3,6}, q roots {0,2,5,9}: difference = 0.282 \u003e 0 (strict)\n  n=4: equal-gap p,q with various spacings: difference = 0.0006 to 0.004 \u003e 0 (strict)\n  n=5: p roots {0,1,3,6,10}, q roots {0,2,5,9,14}: difference = 0.406 \u003e 0 (strict)\n  n=5: equal-gap, various spacings: difference = 0.001 to 0.006 \u003e 0 (strict)\n  n=4: 500 random pairs, minimum difference = 0.023 \u003e 0 (all strict)\n\nCONDITIONAL STATUS: The claim \"strict for ALL pairs\" requires the main inequality from 1.5 to exclude the possibility that the inequality goes the wrong way. What is unconditionally established:\n  (i) For specific (p,q) pairs, we can verify both the inequality AND its strictness by direct computation.\n  (ii) Equal-gap structure is NOT preserved by MSS convolution for n \u003e= 4 (this is unconditional).\n  (iii) No equality cases exist in any tested sample (unconditional numerical evidence).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"c876a3d13734bff66f7f23f41e243b0cccf7cbbd5e872482a64de31cc779a183","created":"2026-02-08T12:37:41.339159814Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
