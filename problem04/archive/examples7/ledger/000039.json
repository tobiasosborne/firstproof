By MSS_derivative_formula, r'(x) = n * s(x) where s = p^{(1)} ⊞_{n-1} q^{(1)} is a monic degree-(n-1) polynomial with n-1 simple real roots gamma_1 \u003c ... \u003c gamma_{n-1} that interlace with the lambda_i. CORRECTED FORMULA (the original statement had two errors: a typo H_r = r'/2r' instead of r''/2r', and an incorrect subtraction term in the final expression): Since r'(x) = n * prod_{k=1}^{n-1}(x - gamma_k) and r''(x) = n * sum_{k=1}^{n-1} prod_{l \\!= k}(x - gamma_l), we obtain H_r(lambda_i) = r''(lambda_i)/(2r'(lambda_i)) = (1/2) * sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1/(lambda_i - gamma_k). Therefore Phi_n(r) = (1/4) * sum_{i=1}^n [sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1/(lambda_i - gamma_k)]^2. As a corollary, H_r(lambda_i) = sum_{j\\!=i} 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j) = (1/2) * sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1/(lambda_i - gamma_k), giving a nontrivial partial fraction identity connecting the roots and critical points of r.","owner":"prover-3"}
