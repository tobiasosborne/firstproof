This framing is misleading.\n\nFor n=3, the cumulant representation DIRECTLY PROVES superadditivity of 1/Phi_3 via an elementary Cauchy-Schwarz argument:\n1. 1/Phi_3 = (2/9)*k2 - (2/27)*k3^2/k2^2  (linear + superadditive parts)\n2. The linear part k2 is additive under convolution.\n3. The function -k3^2/k2^2 is superadditive for k2\u003e0 by Cauchy-Schwarz.\n4. Therefore 1/Phi_3 is superadditive. QED.\n\nThe node should acknowledge that the cumulant framework can be SUFFICIENT for proving superadditivity (at least for n=3), not merely 'constraining'. The claim that 'the additivity of cumulants under convolution then constrains Phi_n(r)' undersells the power of the approach.\n\nAdditionally, for n=2 (as correctly noted in 1.5.2.4), superadditivity holds with EXACT EQUALITY, which is also a cumulant proof (Phi_2 = 1/k2, and 1/(a+b) \u003c= 1/a for a,b\u003e0 is trivially superadditive).\n\nWhether this approach extends to n\u003e=4 remains open, but the blanket 'insufficiency' claim is false.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
