The roots of r are lambda_1 \u003c ... \u003c lambda_n (simple, by MSS_real_rootedness). By the MSS_derivative_formula, r'(x) = n * s(x) where s(x) = (p^{(1)} ⊞_{n-1} q^{(1)})(x) and p^{(1)} = p'/n, q^{(1)} = q'/n are the derived polynomials of degree n-1. Since p^{(1)} and q^{(1)} are monic degree-(n-1) polynomials with simple real roots (the critical points of p and q respectively, which interlace with their roots by Rolle), and since MSS_real_rootedness applies at degree n-1, the polynomial s = p^{(1)} ⊞_{n-1} q^{(1)} is also a monic degree-(n-1) polynomial with n-1 simple real roots gamma_1 \u003c ... \u003c gamma_{n-1}.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"743bd34f9797e6575def2ec208a894567b0fb25588d6acdff91addde55054ae6","created":"2026-02-08T12:09:50.017149225Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
