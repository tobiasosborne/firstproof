The node does not explicitly state this precondition. For n=1, Phi_1 = 0 for all polynomials, making the equivalence ill-defined in ordinary arithmetic. However, this is handled by the sibling node 1.2, and for n \u003e= 2 we can prove Phi_n(p) \u003e 0 for all p in P_n (since p''(lambda_i) = 0 for all i requires n roots of a degree-(n-2) polynomial, impossible for n \u003e= 2). So this is a minor gap in exposition rather than a mathematical error.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
