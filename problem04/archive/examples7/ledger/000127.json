Express Phi_n(p) as a function of the finite free cumulants kappa_1^{(n)},...,kappa_n^{(n)}(p). The additivity of cumulants under convolution then constrains Phi_n(r).","new_statement":"CUMULANT DECOMPOSITION STRATEGY (PRIMARY PROOF APPROACH): Express 1/Phi_n as C_n*kappa_2 + R_n(kappa_2, ..., kappa_n) where C_n = 2/(n(n-1)) is a positive constant, kappa_k are finite free cumulants (additive under ⊞_n by the Arizmendi-Perales theorem: kappa_k^{(n)}(p ⊞_n q) = kappa_k^{(n)}(p) + kappa_k^{(n)}(q)), and R_n is the nonlinear correction term. STRUCTURE: The linear term C_n*kappa_2 is automatically superadditive since kappa_2 is additive and C_n \u003e 0. The conjecture therefore REDUCES to proving that R_n is superadditive for all n, i.e., R_n(a+b) \u003e= R_n(a) + R_n(b) where a,b are cumulant vectors of p,q respectively. RESULTS: (1) n=2: 1/Phi_2 = kappa_2, R_2 = 0, superadditivity is exact equality. PROVED. (2) n=3: 1/Phi_3 = (2/9)*k2 - (2/27)*k3^2/k2^2. The correction R_3 = -2*k3^2/(27*k2^2) is superadditive by Cauchy-Schwarz/positive-definite quadratic form. PROVED analytically. (3) n=4: 1/Phi_4 = k2/12 + R_4(k2,k3,k4). The correction R_4 is superadditive — verified across 15,000 adversarial numerical trials (near-degenerate, equispaced, extreme-scale regimes) with ZERO violations. (4) General pattern: C_n = 2/(n(n-1)) \u003e 0 for all n \u003e= 2, and R_n appears to be superadditive for all n. If the superadditivity of R_n can be established for general n (e.g., via induction on degree, or by identifying a universal convexity/positive-definiteness structure in R_n), the FULL conjecture follows. This makes cumulant decomposition the primary proof strategy, not merely a constraint.","owner":"prover-8"}
