Assuming subordination (node 1.5.3.2), we have vectors h, alpha, beta in R^n with:\n  u = h + alpha (so ||u||^2 = Phi_n(p))\n  v = h + beta  (so ||v||^2 = Phi_n(q))\n  ||h||^2 = Phi_n(r)\n  alpha - beta = u - v (compatibility)\n\nWe need: ||h||^2 * (||u||^2 + ||v||^2) \u003c= ||u||^2 * ||v||^2.\n\nEQUIVALENT FORM: ||h||^2/||h+alpha||^2 + ||h||^2/||h+beta||^2 \u003c= 1.\n\nThis does NOT hold for arbitrary alpha, beta in R^n satisfying only the compatibility condition. Counterexample: h = (1,0), alpha = (-1-epsilon, 0), beta = (-1-epsilon, 0) gives ||h||^2/||u||^2 = 1/epsilon^2 which violates the bound.\n\nTherefore, the inequality REQUIRES structural constraints on alpha, beta from their origin as omega_i''(lambda_k)/2 where omega_i are Herglotz functions. Specifically:\n\n(1) alpha_i = omega_1''(lambda_i)/2 = -sum_j m_{1j}/(lambda_i - p_{1j})^2 where m_{1j} \u003e 0 are the residues and p_{1j} are the poles of omega_1. This is a CAUCHY MATRIX structure — alpha is not arbitrary.\n\n(2) The poles p_{1j} of omega_1 interlace with the lambda_i (by Herglotz property), providing SIGN CONSTRAINTS on alpha.\n\n(3) The additional identity omega_1(z) + omega_2(z) = z + c + ... (if it holds at finite n, which the strategy document says it does NOT for n=2) would couple alpha and beta.\n\nASSESSMENT: Without the finite summation relation omega_1 + omega_2 = z + F(z), the constraints on alpha and beta are DECOUPLED (they come from independently defined omega_1, omega_2), and we have no mechanism to prove the joint inequality. The problem is fundamentally open.\n\nPOSSIBLE RESOLUTION VIA ALTERNATIVE APPROACH: Rather than subordination, one might seek a proof using the electrostatic/log-potential interpretation of Phi_n. The quantity Phi_n(p) = sum_i H_p(lambda_i)^2 is related to the gradient of the log-energy E(p) = -sum_{i\u003cj} log|lambda_i - lambda_j|. If log-energy is superadditive under MSS convolution (i.e., E(r) \u003e= E(p) + E(q)), the Fisher inequality might follow by differentiation. But log-energy superadditivity is itself unproved and may be harder than the original conjecture.\n\nSTATUS: OPEN. This is equivalent to Hard Lemma 2 in the strategy document. No proof is known.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"695c05f0f229460fb35cb2297b88e6304cb4c71774218cbe258b030b855fcc1d","created":"2026-02-08T12:20:01.055186306Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
