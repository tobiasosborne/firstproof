COROLLARY (Partial fraction identity): Since we also have H_r(lambda_i) = sum_{j!=i} 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j) by the definition of the discrete Hilbert transform, equating the two expressions gives the identity: sum_{j=1, j!=i}^n 1/(lambda_i - lambda_j) = (1/2) * sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1/(lambda_i - gamma_k) for each i = 1, ..., n. This identity is independently verifiable via the partial fraction decomposition of r'(x)/r(x) = sum_i 1/(x - lambda_i).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"641df16ed402c88f58106b0e46871d9da6016dcc4d615b4bcda6188cf4878402","created":"2026-02-08T12:09:50.017163855Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
