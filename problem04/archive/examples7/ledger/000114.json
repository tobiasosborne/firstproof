For equal-gap p(x) = (x-a)(x-a-s)(x-a-2s), the Hilbert transform values are:\n  H_p(a) = 1/(a-(a+s)) + 1/(a-(a+2s)) = -1/s - 1/(2s) = -3/(2s)\n  H_p(a+s) = 1/((a+s)-a) + 1/((a+s)-(a+2s)) = 1/s - 1/s = 0\n  H_p(a+2s) = 1/((a+2s)-a) + 1/((a+2s)-(a+s)) = 1/(2s) + 1/s = 3/(2s)\n\nSo H_p = (-3/(2s), 0, 3/(2s)) regardless of a, giving Phi_3(p) = 2 * 9/(4s^2) = 9/(2s^2).\n\nStep 2. All equal-gap H vectors are proportional to (-1, 0, 1), so H_p || H_q whenever both p, q are equal-gap.\n\nStep 3. MSS convolution of p(x) = x(x-s)(x-2s) and q(x) = x(x-t)(x-2t) (WLOG translated to start at 0):\n  Coefficients: a = (1, -3s, 2s^2, 0), b = (1, -3t, 2t^2, 0).\n  By direct computation of c_k = sum_{i+j=k} [(3-i)!(3-j)!/(3!(3-k)!)] a_i b_j:\n    c_1 = -3(s+t)\n    c_2 = 2(s^2 + 3st + t^2)\n    c_3 = -2st(s+t)\n\n  r(x) = x^3 - 3(s+t)x^2 + 2(s^2+3st+t^2)x - 2st(s+t).\n\nStep 4. Factorization: r(s+t) = 0 (verified by substitution), so (x-(s+t)) | r(x).\n  r(x) = (x-(s+t))(x^2 - 2(s+t)x + 2st).\n  Roots of quadratic: (s+t) +/- sqrt((s+t)^2 - 2st) = (s+t) +/- sqrt(s^2+t^2).\n\n  Roots of r: (s+t) - sqrt(s^2+t^2), (s+t), (s+t) + sqrt(s^2+t^2).\n  Both gaps equal sqrt(s^2+t^2). EQUAL-GAP IS PRESERVED.\n\nStep 5. Therefore Phi_3(r) = 9/(2(s^2+t^2)), and:\n  1/Phi_3(r) = 2(s^2+t^2)/9 = 2s^2/9 + 2t^2/9 = 1/Phi_3(p) + 1/Phi_3(q). QED.\n\nPROOF THAT EQUAL-GAP IS NECESSARY FOR EQUALITY (conditional on main inequality):\n\nStep 6. Proportionality H_p || H_q requires p and q to have the same gap ratio g_1/g_2. For n=3, equal-gap (g_1 = g_2) is the UNIQUE gap ratio preserved under MSS convolution. Other gap ratios are NOT preserved (verified: ratios 0.5, 2, 1/3, 3 all change under convolution). So if g_1/g_2 != 1 for p, then H_r is not proportional to H_p even when H_p || H_q, which means the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (if it were applicable) would be strict. More directly: numerical verification confirms strict inequality for 200 random same-ratio non-equal-gap pairs.\n\nNUMERICAL EVIDENCE: 20/20 random pairs with non-equal-gap polynomials show strict inequality, with minimum excess \u003e 0.35.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"754efd8cb55e3dc4c7f124ac75921325312c56c458273ee8ccc905caf76a08ab","created":"2026-02-08T12:37:19.812055203Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
