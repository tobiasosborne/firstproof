When n=1, there is exactly one root lambda_1 = a, and the sum runs over j in {1,...,1} with j != 1, which is the empty set. Therefore H_p(a) = 0 (empty sum). The same holds for H_q(b) = 0 and H_r(a+b) = 0.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"470b05412e00233eb6b1fa7837a5456d81dfb4781ce9841d8133ce426db466cb","created":"2026-02-08T12:06:49.271405944Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
