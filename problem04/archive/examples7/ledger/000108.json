All claims verified numerically:\n- Phi_n * disc(p) IS a symmetric polynomial in the roots (confirmed for n=2,3,4).\n- The explicit formulas N_2=2, N_3=18*e_2^2 are correct.\n- The n=2 exact equality claim is correct (verified to machine precision).\n- The remark that 'Phi_2 = 1/kappa_2 is convex harmonic' is correctly stated.\n\nMinor note: The COROLLARY says 'the nonlinear relationship prevents simple convexity arguments.' This is true (1/Phi_3 is neither convex nor concave by Hessian analysis), but the subsequent reasoning in sibling node 1.5.2.3 incorrectly concludes that NO cumulant-based proof exists. Node 1.5.2.4 itself is careful enough not to make this overreach, stating only that 'simple convexity arguments' fail, which is accurate.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
