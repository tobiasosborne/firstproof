While these are external references rather than sibling nodes, the dependency structure of the child nodes 1.4.1-1.4.6 is also deficient: none declare dependencies on each other, yet 1.4.2 uses the result of 1.4.1 (simplicity of s roots), 1.4.3 uses 1.4.2 (interlacing), 1.4.4 uses 1.4.3, and 1.4.5 uses 1.4.4. This should be declared to make the proof structure explicit.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
