The argument is: (P1) Phi_n is rational in cumulants, (P2) the discriminant is nonlinear, (P3) therefore no inequality can be derived. But P3 is FALSE for n=3!\n\nEXPLICIT COUNTEREXAMPLE: For n=3, 1/Phi_3 = (2/9)*k2 - (2/27)*k3^2/k2^2. Superadditivity of 1/Phi_3 under additive cumulants reduces to: (k3_p+k3_q)^2/(k2_p+k2_q)^2 \u003c= k3_p^2/k2_p^2 + k3_q^2/k2_q^2. Setting x=k3_p/k2_p, y=k3_q/k2_q, s=k2_p/(k2_p+k2_q), t=k2_q/(k2_p+k2_q), this becomes (sx+ty)^2 \u003c= x^2+y^2, which follows from Cauchy-Schwarz/Jensen since s+t=1 and 0\u003cs,t\u003c1. The proof is elementary and uses ONLY cumulant additivity + the specific rational form.\n\nThe node is correct that 1/Phi_3 is neither convex nor concave (verified by Hessian analysis: det(H)=-16*k3^2/(729*k2^6) \u003c= 0). But superadditivity f(a+b)\u003e=f(a)+f(b) is STRICTLY WEAKER than concavity. The node confuses these two properties.\n\nCONCLUSION: The cumulant framework IS sufficient for n=3 and potentially for higher n. The 'insufficiency' conclusion must be retracted or qualified to specify which specific proof strategy fails, rather than claiming the entire framework is insufficient.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
