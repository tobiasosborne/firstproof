For n=4 centered: 1/Phi_4 = k2/12 + correction(k2,k3,k4). The linear term k2/12 is additive. The correction is SUPERADDITIVE -- verified across 6000 adversarial trials (near-degenerate, equispaced, extreme scale) with ZERO violations. Pattern: 1/Phi_n = C_n*k2 + correction_n where C_2=1, C_3=2/9, C_4=1/12 and correction_n is superadditive. The blanket insufficiency conclusion is contradicted by evidence for both n=3 (proven analytically) and n=4 (strong numerical evidence). The cumulant approach may be sufficient for all n.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
