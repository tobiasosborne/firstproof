(2) Key Lemma algebra (s+t)C-sA-tB=12st(s+t)-tu-sv verified symbolically. (3) Lower bound 8st(s+t)\u003e0 correct, uses only upper bounds on u,v. (4) Cauchy-Schwarz substitution valid and correctly applied. (5) Logical chain direction correct (negative factor flips inequality). (6) Domain complete: sum constraints automatic from individual ones. (7) 0 counterexamples in ~1.5M aggressive numerical trials. (8) Edge/boundary cases all positive. Proof is correct and complete."}
