Rolle's theorem only guarantees at least one root in each gap between consecutive roots of p, hence at least n-1 real roots of p'. It does NOT guarantee simplicity. The simplicity of roots of p' (when p has all simple real roots) requires an additional argument: if p'(c) = p''(c) = 0 with c between consecutive roots of p, then p(c) \\!= 0 and the logarithmic derivative identity d/dx(p'/p) = -sum 1/(x-a_i)^2 evaluated at c gives p''(c)/p(c) = -sum 1/(c-a_i)^2 \u003c 0, contradicting p''(c) = 0. This standard but nontrivial fact should be stated explicitly or cited.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
