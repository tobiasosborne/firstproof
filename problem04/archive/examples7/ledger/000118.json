VERIFIER-7 independently confirms this assessment: numerical testing (1000 trials each, n=3,4,5) shows log-energy E(p) = -sum_{i\u003cj} log|lambda_i - lambda_j| is NEITHER super- nor sub-additive under MSS convolution (569/1000 violations of superadditivity at n=3, rising to 650/1000 at n=5). Similarly, the discriminant disc(r) is neither systematically larger nor smaller than disc(p)*disc(q). This rules out the electrostatic energy approach as a viable alternative to subordination. The node's assessment is accurate.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
