The actual issue is that E[f'/f] \\!= E[f']/E[f] (expectation does not commute with taking ratios). Jensen's inequality applies to convex/concave functions, but the function f -\u003e f'/f (or equivalently f -\u003e d/dz log f) is not generally convex or concave in f. The non-equality is correct, but attributing it to 'Jensen' is wrong. The correct explanation is simply that E[X/Y] \\!= E[X]/E[Y] in general (the ratio of expectations differs from the expectation of ratios). One could salvage the Jensen argument by considering log: E[log f] \\!= log E[f] by Jensen (since log is concave), and then differentiating in z, but the node does not state this. As written, the attribution to Jensen is an error of mathematical reasoning even though the conclusion (non-equality) is correct.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
