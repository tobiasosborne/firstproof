The Cauchy matrix bound (Frobenius norm) used is too weak: it gives Phi_n(r) \u003c= (n-1)/4 * ||C||_F^2 where ||C||_F^2 depends on the specific interlacing of lambda_i and gamma_k, but does NOT involve Phi_n(p) or Phi_n(q) in any way. The two gaps identified ((a) relating Phi_n(r) to Phi_{n-1}(s), and (b) relating Phi_{n-1}(p^{(1)}) to Phi_n(p)) are not just 'open' -- gap (b) is actually a well-studied problem in random matrix theory (monotonicity of Fisher information under taking derivatives/minors) and is itself a nontrivial inequality. The word 'promising' should be qualified with the severity of these sub-problems.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
