At the Gaussian locus (kappa_3=...=kappa_n=0), the polynomial is s^{n/2}*He_n(x/sqrt(s)) where He_n is the probabilist's Hermite polynomial. Using He_n identities: H_i = xi_i/2 at Hermite roots, sum(xi_i^2) = n(n-1), giving Phi_n = n(n-1)/(4s), hence 1/Phi_n = (-2/C(n,2))*kappa_2. Verified n=2,...,14. The original conjecture C_n=2/(n(n-1)) was wrong by factor 2/n. Correct values: C_2=1, C_3=2/9, C_4=1/12, C_5=1/25, C_6=1/45. Additionally: MSS convolution = binomial convolution of normalized coefficients (W_k(i,j)=C(k,i)), additive cumulants are LOG of EGF (universal, independent of degree n). R_n IS superadditive for centered polynomials: 0 violations for n=3,4,5 across 25000+ trials. Full 1/Phi_n superadditivity: 0 violations for n=3,4,5,6 across 25000+ trials.
