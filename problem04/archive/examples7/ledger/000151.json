{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-08T13:59:18.151398461Z","node_id":"1.5.5.1","note":"All 7 claims independently verified via adversarial testing with different random seed (99991 vs prover's 42), independent MSS implementation, symbolic EGF log verification, and adversarial test battery (near-degenerate roots, scale asymmetry, outlier roots). C_n=4/(n^2(n-1)) confirmed for n=2,...,10. R_n\u003c=0 confirmed for n=3,...,8. R_n superadditivity: 0 violations in ~3000 adversarial trials per n. Minor note: prover code has inconsistent C_n(ta) comment (does not affect results). Full report: examples7/verifier10b_report.md, script: examples7/verifier10b_check.py."}
