Express Phi_n(p) as a function of the finite free cumulants kappa_1^{(n)},...,kappa_n^{(n)}(p). The additivity of cumulants under convolution then constrains Phi_n(r).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"31b909d4f22db58da5d0da12bad4a5c1d4273540ddd86ad5c44d1c49d33a52e3","created":"2026-02-08T12:05:39.209928811Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
