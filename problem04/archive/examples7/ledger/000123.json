The node frames cumulants as merely constraining Phi_n(r). In fact: (1) For n=2: 1/Phi_2 = kappa_2, superadditivity is trivial from additivity. (2) For n=3: 1/Phi_3 = (2/9)*k2 - (2/27)*k3^2/k2^2, superadditivity proved via positive-definite quadratic form (elementary, no subordination needed). (3) For n=4: 1/Phi_4 = k2/12 + correction, where correction is superadditive (verified 6000 adversarial trials, 0 violations). General pattern: 1/Phi_n = C_n*k2 + correction_n with C_n\u003e0 and correction_n superadditive in (k2,...,kn). If this holds for all n, the ENTIRE superadditivity conjecture follows from cumulant additivity alone. This makes the cumulant approach potentially the MAIN proof strategy rather than a dead end. The node should be amended to highlight this structural discovery.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
