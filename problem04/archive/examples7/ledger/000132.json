For centered monic degree-3 polynomials with simple real roots, we have 1/Phi_3 = (2/9)*kappa_2 - (2/27)*kappa_3^2/kappa_2^2 where kappa_2, kappa_3 are finite free cumulants (additive under ⊞_3). Write 1/Phi_3 = C_3*kappa_2 + R_3 where C_3 = 2/9 and R_3 = -(2/27)*kappa_3^2/kappa_2^2.\n\nPROOF OF R_3 SUPERADDITIVITY: We must show R_3(s_p + s_q, u_p + u_q) \u003e= R_3(s_p, u_p) + R_3(s_q, u_q) where s = kappa_2 \u003e 0 and u = kappa_3. Equivalently: (u_p + u_q)^2/(s_p + s_q)^2 \u003c= u_p^2/s_p^2 + u_q^2/s_q^2 for s_p, s_q \u003e 0. Setting x = u_p/s_p, y = u_q/s_q, t = s_p/(s_p + s_q) so that 1-t = s_q/(s_p + s_q), the LHS becomes (tx + (1-t)y)^2 and the RHS is x^2 + y^2 \u003e= (tx + (1-t)y)^2 since t in (0,1). This follows from Jensen's inequality applied to the convex function z -\u003e z^2, or equivalently from the variance identity: E[X^2] \u003e= (E[X])^2.\n\nALTERNATIVE (MATRIX) PROOF: Define the quadratic form Q(u_p, u_q) = (u_p^2/s_p^2 + u_q^2/s_q^2) - (u_p + u_q)^2/(s_p + s_q)^2. The associated 2x2 matrix is M = (2/27) * [[1/s_p^2 - 1/(s_p+s_q)^2, -1/(s_p+s_q)^2], [-1/(s_p+s_q)^2, 1/s_q^2 - 1/(s_p+s_q)^2]]. Rewriting with s = s_p, t = s_q: det(M) is proportional to 2*s^3*t^3*(s+t)^2 \u003e 0 for s,t \u003e 0, and trace \u003e 0, so M is positive definite. Therefore Q \u003e= 0 for all (u_p, u_q), establishing superadditivity.\n\nCombined with the automatic superadditivity of the linear term C_3*kappa_2 (since kappa_2 is additive and C_3 \u003e 0), 1/Phi_3(p ⊞_3 q) \u003e= 1/Phi_3(p) + 1/Phi_3(q).
