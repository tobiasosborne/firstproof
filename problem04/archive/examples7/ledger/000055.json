Since it invokes an external result rather than positing a new axiom, the inference type should arguably be something like 'external_application' or 'deduction' rather than 'assumption'. Marking it as an assumption suggests it is a postulated hypothesis, when in fact it follows from the cited MSS theorem. This is a metadata/classification issue rather than a mathematical error.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
