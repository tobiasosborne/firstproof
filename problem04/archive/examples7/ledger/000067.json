(a) MSS convolution for n=1: manually computed c_0=1, c_1=-(a+b), giving r(x)=x-(a+b). Correct. (b) Empty Hilbert transform: sum over j in {1} with j\\!=1 is empty. Also verified via derivative formula: p''=0 so H_p=0. Correct. (c) Phi_1=0: sum of one zero-squared term. Correct. (d) Extended-real convention: 1/0=+inf, inf+inf=inf, inf\u003e=inf. Standard convention in measure theory and information theory. Sound. Note: harmonic-mean form in 1.2.5 gives 0/0 which is genuinely undefined (minor challenge raised). (e) Meaningfulness: the n=1 case is degenerate (Phi identically 0), but it validates correctly under extended-real arithmetic. Phi_n\u003e0 for n\u003e=2 since p'' has degree n-2 and cannot vanish at all n roots. Two minor issues raised: (1) 'vacuously' should be 'trivially', (2) harmonic-mean form is ill-defined for n=1."}
