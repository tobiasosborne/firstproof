The node claims: 'The key algebraic identity underlying this cancellation is that the MSS coefficient (n-i)!(n-j)!/(n!(n-k)!) = C(n-i,j)^{-1} * C(n,k)^{-1} * C(n,i) * C(n,j).'\n\nThis identity is NUMERICALLY FALSE for all non-trivial cases. Tested for n=3,4,5:\n- n=3, i=1, j=1: LHS = 2/3, RHS = 3/2\n- n=3, i=1, j=2: LHS = 1/3, RHS = 9\n- n=4, i=1, j=1: LHS = 3/4, RHS = 8/9\n- n=4, i=2, j=2: LHS = 1/6, RHS = 36\n\nThe OVERALL additivity theorem (kappa_k(p conv q) = kappa_k(p) + kappa_k(q)) is CORRECT -- verified numerically to machine precision for k2 and k3 with n=3. The error is confined to the 'proof sketch': the specific algebraic identity cited as the 'key' mechanism is wrong. The actual mechanism of cancellation under Mobius inversion may work by a different identity. This does not affect the theorem statement but the proof sketch is unreliable.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
