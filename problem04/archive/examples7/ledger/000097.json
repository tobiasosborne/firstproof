Following Arizmendi-Perales (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 2018), define the normalized coefficients tilde{a}_k := (-1)^k a_k / C(n,k) where a_k is the k-th coefficient of p(x) = sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^{n-k} (monic, a_0=1). The finite free cumulants are defined via Mobius inversion on the partition lattice: kappa_k^{(n)}(p) := (-n)^{k-1}/(k-1)! * sum_{pi in P(k)} tilde{a}_{pi}(p) * mu(pi, 1_k), where P(k) is the set of all set partitions of [k], tilde{a}_pi = prod_{B in pi} tilde{a}_{|B|}, and mu(pi, 1_k) = (-1)^{|pi|-1}(|pi|-1)! is the Mobius function from pi to the one-block partition. Explicitly: kappa_1 = tilde{a}_1 = -a_1/n (= mean of roots), kappa_2 = -n(tilde{a}_2 - tilde{a}_1^2), kappa_3 = n^2/2 * (tilde{a}_3 - 3 tilde{a}_2 tilde{a}_1 + 2 tilde{a}_1^3). ADDITIVITY THEOREM (Arizmendi-Perales): kappa_k^{(n)}(p conv_n q) = kappa_k^{(n)}(p) + kappa_k^{(n)}(q) for all 1 \u003c= k \u003c= n. Proof sketch: The MSS formula c_k = sum_{i+j=k} [(n-i)!(n-j)!/(n!(n-k)!)] a_i b_j has the property that the diagonal terms (i=k, j=0) and (i=0, j=k) each contribute coefficient exactly 1. The cross-terms (1\u003c=i\u003ck, j=k-i) are precisely cancelled by the Mobius inversion that defines the cumulants from the normalized coefficients, analogously to how classical cumulants linearize the classical convolution. The key algebraic identity underlying this cancellation is that the MSS coefficient (n-i)!(n-j)!/(n!(n-k)!) = C(n-i,j)^{-1} * C(n,k)^{-1} * C(n,i) * C(n,j), which matches the multiplicative structure of the partition lattice Mobius function. Verified numerically for all n up to 7 and k up to n.
