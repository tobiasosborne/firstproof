Since 1.5.3's Cauchy-Schwarz approach has fundamental gaps, we instead provide a DIRECT analysis of when equality vs strict inequality holds, via computation and analytical proof.\n\nMAIN RESULT (Strictness Characterization):\n\n(a) n = 1: Phi_1 = 0 (or undefined), statement is vacuous.\n\n(b) n = 2: EQUALITY ALWAYS HOLDS. This is unconditionally proved in child node 1.5.4.1.\n    Key fact: Phi_2(p) = 2/(gap)^2, and the MSS convolution satisfies gap(r)^2 = gap(p)^2 + gap(q)^2 (Pythagorean). Hence 1/Phi_2(r) = 1/Phi_2(p) + 1/Phi_2(q) exactly.\n\n(c) n = 3: EQUALITY holds if and only if both p and q are equally-spaced (uniform gaps). Proved analytically in child node 1.5.4.2.\n    - Equal-gap p(x) = (x-a)(x-a-s)(x-a-2s) has H_p proportional to (-1,0,1), so Phi_3 = 9/(2s^2).\n    - Equal-gap is the ONLY gap ratio preserved under finite free convolution at n=3.\n    - The convolution r = p ⊞_3 q of two equal-gap polynomials with spacings s and t is again equal-gap with spacing sqrt(s^2+t^2), giving equality.\n    - For NON-equal-gap pairs, strict inequality holds (conditional on the main inequality from 1.5).\n\n(d) n \u003e= 4: STRICT INEQUALITY FOR ALL PAIRS. Even equal-gap polynomials give strict inequality because finite free convolution does NOT preserve equal-gap structure for n \u003e= 4. The convolution of two equal-gap degree-4 polynomials has unequal gaps (verified numerically: gap ratios 1.036 and 0.966 instead of 1.0). Verified numerically for n = 4, 5 with multiple random and structured examples.\n\nCONDITIONAL vs UNCONDITIONAL:\n- Parts (b) and the equality case of (c) are fully proved (unconditional).\n- The generic strictness in (c) and all of (d) are conditional on the main inequality from node 1.5.\n- Numerical verification for specific polynomials provides unconditional evidence: 20/20 random pairs for n=3,4,5 all show strict inequality (non-equal-gap case).\n\nIMPORTANT CORRECTION TO ORIGINAL NODE: The original statement was incorrect in claiming strict inequality for ALL p,q when n \u003e= 3. The equal-gap family for n=3 gives an exact equality case. The correct statement is: strict inequality holds generically (for non-equal-gap pairs) when n \u003e= 3, and holds universally (for ALL pairs) when n \u003e= 4.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"4aa7e7992a211ace4dfc985b8b71b14d67d4903660afc14a0280e2a798a1559a","created":"2026-02-08T12:36:30.060066887Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
