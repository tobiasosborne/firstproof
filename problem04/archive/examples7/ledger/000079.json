Then the chain rule gives:\n\n  h_i := H_r(lambda_i) = H_p(omega_1(lambda_i)) - alpha_i = H_q(omega_2(lambda_i)) - beta_i\n\nwhere alpha_i = omega_1''(lambda_i)/2 \u003e= 0, beta_i = omega_2''(lambda_i)/2. Setting u_i = H_p(omega_1(lambda_i)), v_i = H_q(omega_2(lambda_i)), the bijection property gives ||u||^2 = Phi_n(p), ||v||^2 = Phi_n(q), ||h||^2 = Phi_n(r).\n\nWith u = h + alpha, v = h + beta, and h = u - alpha, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in Titu's lemma (Engel) form gives:\n\n  ||h||^2 = sum_i h_i^2 = sum_i (u_i - alpha_i)^2.\n\nBy Cauchy-Schwarz: (sum_i h_i^2)^2 \u003c= (sum_i h_i^2/w_i) * (sum_i h_i^2 * w_i) for any positive weights w_i.\n\nThe KEY remaining question is: what constraint on (alpha, beta) implies ||h||^2/||u||^2 + ||h||^2/||v||^2 \u003c= 1?\n\nExpanding: ||h||^2/||u||^2 + ||h||^2/||v||^2 \u003c= 1 iff ||h||^2 * ||v||^2 + ||h||^2 * ||u||^2 \u003c= ||u||^2 * ||v||^2 iff ||h||^2 * (||u||^2 + ||v||^2) \u003c= ||u||^2 * ||v||^2.\n\nThis is exactly: (||h + alpha||^2 + ||h + beta||^2) * ||h||^2 \u003c= ||h+alpha||^2 * ||h+beta||^2.\n\nBy AM-GM: ||h+alpha||^2 * ||h+beta||^2 \u003e= ((||h+alpha||^2 + ||h+beta||^2)/2)^2, so a sufficient condition is:\n\n  ||h||^2 \u003c= (||h+alpha||^2 + ||h+beta||^2)/4.\n\nBut this is too strong (it fails for small alpha, beta). The correct approach requires the specific COUPLING between alpha and beta provided by the subordination structure — namely that alpha - beta = u - v (compatibility) and that alpha, beta arise from Herglotz representations. This coupling is what makes the problem hard and is analyzed in node 1.5.3.3 (Hard Lemma 2 in the strategy document).\n\nSTATUS: This node establishes the reduction framework. The actual inequality proof requires resolving Hard Lemma 2 (node 1.5.3.3), which is the core open problem.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"396738ddaa7981c55cb5c9adb8dce78bde0bef4bdb40c66e912c6033dd7dc3d8","created":"2026-02-08T12:19:39.976485333Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
