This is not vacuous truth -- vacuous truth means the hypothesis is false. Here the inequality is directly evaluated in extended reals as +infinity \u003e= +infinity, which is true by reflexivity. The correct wording would be 'holds trivially' rather than 'holds vacuously.' This is purely a terminology issue, not a mathematical error.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
