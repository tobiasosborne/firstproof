For z in C\\R and r a real polynomial with only real roots, r(z) is a nonzero complex number, and log r(z) requires a branch choice. The standard convention is to take the principal branch, which makes log r(z) holomorphic on C\\R (since r(z) never crosses the negative real axis for z in C^+ when r has only real roots). While this is a standard convention that experts would understand, a proof node should be explicit about it. Additionally, the notation G_r(z) = (1/n) d/dz log r(z) is potentially confused with the more common notation G_mu(z) = integral 1/(z-t) dmu(t) for the Cauchy-Stieltjes transform of a measure. For the empirical root measure mu_r = (1/n) sum delta_{lambda_i}, we have G_{mu_r}(z) = (1/n) sum 1/(z-lambda_i) = (1/n) r'(z)/r(z), which does equal (1/n) d/dz log r(z). So the formula is correct but the notation conflation should be noted.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
