It makes three observations: (1) r(x) = E_U[chi_{A+UBU*}(x)] by MSS, (2) the expected resolvent E[g(U)] is not equal to G_r(z), and (3) the MSS formula gives an exact polynomial identity. None of these observations are used by the sibling nodes 1.5.2, 1.5.3, or 1.5.4. Node 1.5.2 proceeds via finite free cumulants, 1.5.3 via Cauchy-Schwarz, and 1.5.4 via strictness analysis -- none reference the random matrix model or resolvent decomposition from 1.5.1. Moreover, the node has no dependencies and nothing depends on it. It appears to be an observational remark that was placed as a proof step. If this is meant to be motivational context rather than a proof step, it should be reclassified or archived. As a proof step under the MAIN INEQUALITY, it fails to advance the argument.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
