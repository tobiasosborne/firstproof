THEOREM: For any monic polynomial p of degree n with simple real roots, Phi_n(p) * disc(p) is a symmetric polynomial in the roots. Proof: Write Phi_n = (1/4) sum_{i=1}^n (p''(lambda_i)/p'(lambda_i))^2. Since p'(lambda_i) = prod_{j\\!=i}(lambda_i - lambda_j), we have 1/p'(lambda_i)^2 = 1/prod_{j\\!=i}(lambda_i-lambda_j)^2. Now disc(p) = prod_{i\u003cj}(lambda_i-lambda_j)^2 = prod_i |p'(lambda_i)| (up to sign), so disc(p)/p'(lambda_i)^2 = prod_{j\u003ck, {j,k}\\!={i,...}}(lambda_j-lambda_k)^2 * sign, which is a polynomial in the roots. Meanwhile p''(lambda_i)^2 = [2*sum_{j\\!=i} prod_{k\\!=i,k\\!=j}(lambda_i-lambda_k)]^2 is also a polynomial. Their product summed over i gives a symmetric polynomial. This identity Phi_n * disc = N_n is the fundamental structural result. COROLLARY: Under MSS convolution, the additivity of cumulants determines the coefficients of r = p conv_n q, hence determines both N_n(r) and disc(r), hence determines Phi_n(r). But the nonlinear relationship prevents simple convexity arguments. REMARK: For n=2, disc = (a-b)^2 = -4*e_2 (centered), N_2 = 2, giving Phi_2 = -1/(2*e_2) = 1/kappa_2. For n=3, disc = -4*e_2^3-27*e_3^2, N_3 = 18*e_2^2, giving the n=3 formula. The n=2 case achieves EXACT EQUALITY in superadditivity because Phi_2 = 1/kappa_2 is convex harmonic in the single cumulant, and kappa_2 is additive.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"aab6f0aa7303984ca519a4bdfc11b16c1a761ac6e5610ee2e4502c9583becd7d","created":"2026-02-08T12:28:29.129573228Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
