For n=1, all three Phi values are 0. Under the standard convention 1/0 = +infinity in the extended reals [0,+infinity], this becomes +infinity \u003e= +infinity + +infinity. In the extended reals, +infinity + +infinity = +infinity, and +infinity \u003e= +infinity holds. Alternatively, the harmonic-mean form Phi_n(r) \u003c= Phi_n(p)*Phi_n(q)/(Phi_n(p)+Phi_n(q)) becomes 0 \u003c= 0*0/(0+0) = 0/0. Under the convention that 0/0 = 0 (or that the bound is vacuous when both sides are 0), this also holds. The most natural reading: since Phi_1 is identically 0, the reciprocal 1/Phi_1 is identically +infinity, and the inequality holds trivially in the extended reals. QED for n=1.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"f28a20bbfc2c42c7126e4b252ace2277772d20b1d8cdd55cdc0e6c0200473e81","created":"2026-02-08T12:06:49.271411879Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
