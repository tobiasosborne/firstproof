Since r'(x) = n * s(x) = n * prod_{k=1}^{n-1}(x - gamma_k), the roots of r' are exactly gamma_1, ..., gamma_{n-1}. Therefore lambda_1 \u003c gamma_1 \u003c lambda_2 \u003c gamma_2 \u003c ... \u003c gamma_{n-1} \u003c lambda_n. This strict interlacing ensures that lambda_i - gamma_k != 0 for all i, k, making all terms 1/(lambda_i - gamma_k) well-defined.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"31b4bb3af856e8a4482d7793b2f709db86c6bf2d546af50694ce4a106c167a88","created":"2026-02-08T12:09:50.017154035Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
