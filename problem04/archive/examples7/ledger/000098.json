For a monic polynomial p(x) = prod_{i=1}^n (x - lambda_i) with simple roots, define disc(p) = prod_{i\u003cj}(lambda_i - lambda_j)^2 and Phi_n(p) = sum_i H_p(lambda_i)^2. CLAIM: Phi_n(p) = N_n(e_2,...,e_n) / disc(p) where N_n is a specific homogeneous polynomial of weight n(n-1)-2 in the elementary symmetric polynomials. Proof: Since H_p(lambda_i) = p''(lambda_i)/(2p'(lambda_i)) and p'(lambda_i) = prod_{j \\!= i}(lambda_i - lambda_j), we have Phi_n = (1/4) sum_i (p''(lambda_i))^2 / p'(lambda_i)^2. Each p''(lambda_i)^2 is a symmetric polynomial of the roots (weight 2(n-2)), and each 1/p'(lambda_i)^2 contributes poles. Multiplying by disc(p) = prod_i p'(lambda_i) * (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} (up to sign), we find Phi_n * disc is a symmetric polynomial. EXPLICIT FORMULAS (centered case e_1=0): n=2: Phi_2 * disc = 2 (constant, confirming Phi_2 = 2/(a-b)^2). n=3: Phi_3 * disc = 18 * e_2^2, giving Phi_3 = 18*e_2^2/(-4*e_2^3 - 27*e_3^2). n=4: Phi_4 * disc = -8*e_2^5 - 36*e_2^2*e_3^2 - 64*e_2^3*e_4 - 432*e_3^2*e_4 + 384*e_2*e_4^2. These formulas are verified numerically to machine precision (relative error \u003c 10^{-13}). The numerator N_n grows in complexity with n, but is always a homogeneous polynomial in e_2,...,e_n of the correct weight.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"d8e8f64f766e4635e682d935b2c70516ef96d5f4d99759a8e4bce41e526f0a67","created":"2026-02-08T12:27:53.550211576Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
