It is needed for approaches A and B.\n(G2) Even assuming subordination, the coupling between alpha and beta needed to prove the vector inequality — this is \"Hard Lemma 2\" and is the deepest gap.\n(G3) A direct relationship between Phi_n(r) and Phi_{n-1}(s) for the inductive approach — this requires understanding how the Cauchy matrix C_{ik} = 1/(lambda_i - gamma_k) transforms Fisher information between levels.\n(G4) A cumulant-based proof — blocked because Phi_n is not convex in the cumulants.\n\nWHY STANDARD CAUCHY-SCHWARZ FAILS:\nThe inequality Phi_n(r) \u003c= Phi_n(p) * Phi_n(q) / (Phi_n(p) + Phi_n(q)) is the harmonic mean. Standard Cauchy-Schwarz gives:\n  (sum a_i b_i)^2 \u003c= (sum a_i^2)(sum b_i^2)\nwhich bounds a PRODUCT from below, not a harmonic mean. To get a harmonic mean bound, one needs either:\n  (i) A decomposition h = alpha*f + beta*g with alpha + beta = 1, then (alpha*f + beta*g)^2 \u003c= alpha*f^2 + beta*g^2 (convexity of squares), optimize over alpha to get harmonic mean. But this requires f, g to be defined on the same index set and related to H_p, H_q — which is exactly what subordination provides.\n  (ii) Titu's lemma: sum h_i^2/(a_i + b_i) \u003c= sum h_i^2/a_i * sum h_i^2/b_i / (sum h_i^2/a_i + sum h_i^2/b_i) — but the denominators a_i, b_i must be defined on the same index set as h_i.\n\nIn both cases, the bottleneck is the SAME: we need to lift H_p and H_q (defined on different root sets) into the same space as H_r. This is precisely what subordination does.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: The node 1.5.3 as originally stated assumes that a direct Cauchy-Schwarz argument exists using cumulant additivity from 1.5.2. This appears to be FALSE — cumulant additivity alone is insufficient because Phi_n is not a convex function of cumulants. The proof, if it exists, must use additional structure from the MSS convolution (either subordination or the derivative formula or both). The proof tree should be amended to reflect that 1.5.3 depends on resolving Hard Lemma 1 (subordination existence) and Hard Lemma 2 (correction vector bounds), or on finding an entirely different approach.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"5a5ab2058c8513720995ff2e45ef2205703afd331f4fedaa6040bba05aaec230","created":"2026-02-08T12:20:54.390354873Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
