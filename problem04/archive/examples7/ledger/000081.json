This is a reformulation of Strategy 3 from the strategy reports.\n\nKey idea: By Admitted C (MSS derivative formula), r'(x) = n * s(x) where s = p^(1) ⊞_{n-1} q^(1). If we assume subordination at level n-1 for the polynomial s (which is the convolution of lower-degree polynomials), then there exist omega_1^(1), omega_2^(1) such that G_s = G_{p^(1)}(omega_1^(1)) = G_{q^(1)}(omega_2^(1)).\n\nThe critical points gamma_k of r are the roots of s. At each gamma_k, the chain rule applied to the level-(n-1) subordination gives:\n\n  H_s(gamma_k) = H_{p^(1)}(omega_1^(1)(gamma_k)) * [omega_1^(1)]'(gamma_k)\n\nand [omega_1^(1)]'(gamma_k) \u003e 0 by the Herglotz property (strictly positive at regular points).\n\nINDUCTIVE STRUCTURE: If subordination exists at level n-1 and the Fisher inequality holds at level n-1, then:\n  1/Phi_{n-1}(s) \u003e= 1/Phi_{n-1}(p^(1)) + 1/Phi_{n-1}(q^(1)).\n\nThe question becomes: can we relate Phi_n(r) to Phi_{n-1}(s)?\n\nRELATION BETWEEN Phi_n(r) AND Phi_{n-1}(s):\nFrom node 1.4: H_r(lambda_i) = (1/2) sum_k 1/(lambda_i - gamma_k).\nMeanwhile: H_s(gamma_k) = sum_{l != k} 1/(gamma_k - gamma_l).\n\nThese are connected by the Cauchy matrix C_{ik} = 1/(lambda_i - gamma_k):\n  H_r(lambda_i) = (1/2) sum_k C_{ik}   (row sums)\n  H_s(gamma_k) relates to column structure\n\nUsing the Cauchy-Binet identity: ||C * x||^2 = sum of (minor)^2 * (x_j x_k ...) terms, we could potentially relate row-wise and column-wise norms. Specifically, by Cauchy-Schwarz on each row:\n\n  H_r(lambda_i)^2 = (1/4)(sum_k C_{ik})^2 \u003c= (1/4)(sum_k C_{ik}^2)(n-1)    [too weak]\n\nThis gives Phi_n(r) \u003c= (n-1)/4 * sum_{i,k} C_{ik}^2 = (n-1)/4 * ||C||_F^2.\n\nThe Frobenius norm ||C||_F^2 = sum_{i,k} 1/(lambda_i - gamma_k)^2 is computable but does not directly relate to Phi_n(p) or Phi_n(q). This approach gives an upper bound on Phi_n(r) but NOT in terms of the harmonic mean of Phi_n(p) and Phi_n(q).\n\nCONCLUSION: The derivative-level approach reduces the problem to one degree lower, suggesting an INDUCTIVE proof strategy. However, the base of induction (n=2, where equality holds) and the inductive step both require additional structure beyond what the Cauchy matrix alone provides. The inductive step needs: (a) a precise relationship between Phi_n(r) and Phi_{n-1}(s), and (b) the ability to relate Phi_{n-1}(p^(1)) to Phi_n(p). Neither (a) nor (b) is established.\n\nSTATUS: This approach is structurally promising for an inductive proof but incomplete. It correctly identifies the descent r -\u003e s = p^(1) ⊞ q^(1) as the key structural feature of MSS convolution, but the quantitative inequalities needed at each step are open.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"d44f722f4d3fd41345add79cd3ae4d64dd09caeca7973f58cf5d4c6572a9bda1","created":"2026-02-08T12:20:27.950921827Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
