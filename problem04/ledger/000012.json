The derivative omega_p'(lambda_i) = 1 [Proved in ex6 via implicit differentiation]. The correction is alpha_i = omega_p''(lambda_i)/2. Therefore H_r(lambda_i) = H_p(mu_sigma(i)) - alpha_i. Setting u_i = H_p(mu_sigma(i)) and h_i = H_r(lambda_i), we have h = u - alpha and Phi_n(p) = ||u||^2, Phi_n(r) = ||h||^2. Similarly h = v - beta with v from q.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"6730e89b17cd3cf2547d99e657ef2801c7eee183b936bf446fc62a54433bf60a","created":"2026-02-08T18:16:43.340404817Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
