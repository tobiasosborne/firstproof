By the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber formula, the joint density of eigenvalues of A+UBU* involves the Vandermonde determinant. If this density is log-concave in the eigenvalue variables, the EPI follows from the Prekopa-Leindler inequality (the standard route for proving EPIs). Alternatively, use the representation-theoretic structure of MSS to establish log-concavity directly.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"4a965ddd9eb0538e58977f1aa6ca19e24be5f2cbb7bf73e6f845c3835b64f61c","created":"2026-02-08T18:16:48.236553941Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
