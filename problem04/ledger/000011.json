These omega are degree-(n-1) rational Herglotz functions with omega_p(z) = z + O(1) at infinity. Existence follows from the implicit function theorem applied to the MSS convolution structure: given G_r(z), solve G_p(w) = G_r(z) for w = omega_p(z). The key is showing the solution is globally well-defined and Herglotz.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"94ac39db18c7731573f66135eb7d24df81fa8052fb55492aca12e80448e14c74","created":"2026-02-08T18:16:43.340400117Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
