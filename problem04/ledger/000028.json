Specifically, omega_p(z) + omega_q(z) = z + F_r(z) where F_r depends only on r (not on the decomposition into p,q). This is the finite analog of the free additive subordination identity. The coupling constrains the joint distribution of (alpha, beta) corrections.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"ee01397ae18758da45538e62b837779bf1eadbe6c8c0d0eca086d8d9e1124a11","created":"2026-02-08T18:17:13.305526197Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
