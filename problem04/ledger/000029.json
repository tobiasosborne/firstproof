The coupling omega_p + omega_q = z + F_r constrains sum m_j^p/(z-p_j^p) + sum m_k^q/(z-p_k^q) = F_r(z) - c_p - c_q. Under this linear constraint on the residues, apply matrix AM-GM: for positive semidefinite matrices A,B with a trace constraint, det(A)*det(B) \u003e= det((A+B)/2)^2. The relevant matrices encode the quadratic forms J_p and J_q in the correction coordinates.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"b0a226d31cf90b51059bd53580b4d367a2c242654306e5a98b1558afc4436feb","created":"2026-02-08T18:17:13.305527897Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
