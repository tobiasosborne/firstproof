Then omega_p-prime(z) = 1 - sum_j m_j/(z-p_j)^2 and omega_p-double-prime(z) = 2*sum_j m_j/(z-p_j)^3. At root lambda_i: alpha_i = sum_j m_j/(lambda_i - p_j)^3. The constraint omega_p-prime(lambda_i) = 1 gives sum_j m_j/(lambda_i - p_j)^2 = 0 for each i (a nontrivial algebraic constraint on the residues m_j and poles p_j).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"dca30691ed5581995438305bb4ba0c1793afd25bdf570ea187b6b640d7bb896d","created":"2026-02-08T18:17:13.305517197Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
