This claim depends entirely on the definition of the t-PushTASEP, which is given in Node 1.4. Node 1.7 inherits all of Node 1.4's defects: the cascade mechanism is omitted, the dynamics are ambiguously described, and the 'locality' claim in Node 1.4 itself has been challenged (ch-31ae7af3f1e664eb). Without a correct and complete definition of the chain's dynamics, Node 1.7 cannot make claims about what the transition rates 'are.' Furthermore, Node 1.7 implicitly uses Node 1.1 (for the definition of S_n(lambda) and the particle system identification) and possibly Node 1.2 (for the definition of F*_mu). None of these dependencies are declared.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
