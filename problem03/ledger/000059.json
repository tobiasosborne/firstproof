This completely omits the defining feature of PushTASEP: the PUSHING CASCADE. According to arXiv:2310.09740 (Ayyer-Martin, t=0 case) and arXiv:2503.00829 (general t), when a particle of species b is activated: (1) it moves clockwise to the first site with a strictly weaker species, (2) with probability (1-t) it displaces that weaker particle (which then becomes ACTIVATED and must itself find an even weaker particle, cascading until a vacancy absorbs), (3) with probability t the pushing particle CONTINUES PAST that weaker particle looking for the NEXT weaker one further clockwise. The cascade terminates only when a vacancy (species 0) is reached. This cascade is what makes PushTASEP 'push' — without it, you have a completely different process. The node mentions none of this: no cascade, no termination condition, no explanation of what happens to the displaced particle. The displacement probability distribution over the i-th weaker particle encountered involves t^(i-1)(1-t)/(1-t^z) where z counts weaker particles — a nontrivial formula absent from the node. This is not a minor omission; the chain is not well-defined without specifying the full transition mechanism.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
