The Hecke relation F*_mu = T_{sigma_mu} E*_lambda holds for formal parameters (q,t). But the probabilistic interpretation (f_mu as stationary weights) requires specific constraints: typically t in [0,1) and x_i \u003e 0. AMW24 likely requires these constraints for the t-PushTASEP to be a well-defined continuous-time Markov chain with finite rates. The node should state the parameter domain, especially since other nodes (1.3 on positivity, 1.4 on chain construction) depend on it.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
