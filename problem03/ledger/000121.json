This is a non sequitur. The TRANSITION MATRIX P(mu-\u003enu) of the (uniformized discrete-time) chain is a function of ALL the parameters (x_1,...,x_n, t) and the full configuration space. Specifically, P(mu-\u003enu) is a rational function of x_1,...,x_n and t (since it involves ratios of rates). The F*_mu(x_1,...,x_n; q=1, t) are also polynomials in x_1,...,x_n and t. There is no a priori reason why a rational function of (x,t) cannot be expressed in terms of other polynomials in (x,t). In fact, for the TRIVIAL chain where P(mu-\u003enu) = pi(nu) = F*_nu/(sum F*_eta), the transition probabilities ARE literally described using F*_mu. The t-PushTASEP is not this trivial chain, but the node makes no attempt to quantify HOW the transition rates differ from expressions involving F*_mu. A rigorous argument might compute P(mu-\u003enu) explicitly for small n and verify it is not a rational expression in {F*_eta}, but the node attempts nothing of this sort.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
