The only route to nonnegativity is via the probabilistic interpretation (stationary probabilities are nonneg), but this requires first establishing F*_mu/P*_lambda = f_mu/P_lambda (Node 1.6), making this node circularly dependent on the conclusion. BDW25 Section 1.4 explicitly defers the interpolation analogue of the probabilistic interpretation to a forthcoming paper.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
