This is mathematically wrong. Write F*_mu = f_mu + g_mu where g_mu collects all monomials of degree \u003c |mu|, and P*_lambda = P_lambda + G where G = sum_mu g_mu. Then: F*_mu/P*_lambda = (f_mu + g_mu)/(P_lambda + G). This equals f_mu/P_lambda if and only if (f_mu + g_mu) * P_lambda = f_mu * (P_lambda + G), which simplifies to g_mu * P_lambda = f_mu * G, i.e., g_mu/f_mu = G/P_lambda for ALL mu simultaneously. This means the RELATIVE correction g_mu/f_mu must be the SAME for every composition mu. There is absolutely no reason why the lower-degree terms in the interpolation polynomial should be the same fraction of the homogeneous part for every composition. In fact, the vanishing conditions defining E*_lambda (and hence f*_mu) impose different constraints on different compositions, making it highly unlikely that g_mu/f_mu is mu-independent. The node treats inhomogeneous corrections as if they trivially cancel in ratios, when in fact this cancellation is the entire content of the claim.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
