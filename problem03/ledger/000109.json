In BDW25 notation: f*_mu (lowercase, asterisk) is the interpolation ASEP polynomial defined algebraically via Hecke operators (Definition 1.2); F*_mu (uppercase, asterisk) is the signed multiline queue generating function (Definition 1.14); f_mu (lowercase, no asterisk) is the homogeneous ASEP polynomial (top-degree part of f*_mu). Theorem 1.15 of BDW25 proves f*_mu = F*_mu, but these are a priori different objects. The node writes 'F*_mu' (uppercase) when it means 'f*_mu' (algebraic object whose top-degree part is f_mu). This notation confusion propagates through the entire argument and makes it impossible to determine which mathematical object the node is actually discussing. When the node says 'F*_mu = f_mu + lower-order terms,' it should say 'f*_mu = f_mu + lower-degree terms' (and note that the 'lower-degree terms' claim follows from BDW25 Theorem 2.3, which says the top homogeneous component of E*_lambda is E_lambda).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
