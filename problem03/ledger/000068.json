But it is not assuming something is true — it is DEFINING/CONSTRUCTING a Markov chain. The node says 'Define a continuous-time Markov chain... via the inhomogeneous multispecies t-PushTASEP.' This is a construction (definition), not an assumption. An assumption would be 'Suppose there exists a chain with property X.' A definition says 'Here is the chain; we will show it has property X.' The inference type should be 'by_definition' to reflect that this is a construction step.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
