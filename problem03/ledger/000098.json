This is a textbook logical error. If {a_mu} and {b_mu} are two sets of n\\! nonneg reals each summing to 1, it does NOT follow that a_mu = b_mu for all mu. For n=2 with S_2(lambda)={(2,0),(0,2)}: the distributions (1/3, 2/3) and (1/2, 1/2) both sum to 1 but are obviously unequal. The normalization condition 'sums to 1' provides exactly ONE linear constraint on n\\! unknowns, leaving an (n\\!-1)-dimensional family of valid distributions. For n=3, there are 6 compositions and the 'both sum to 1' argument would need 5 additional independent equations to pin down the distribution uniquely — the node provides ZERO. This gap is not a technicality; it is the entire missing content of the proof.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
