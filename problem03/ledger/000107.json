The claim F*_mu(x;q=1,t)/P*_lambda(x;q=1,t) = f_mu(x;q=1,t)/P_lambda(x;q=1,t) is a statement about evaluations of polynomials, and its truth depends on: (a) Whether x_1,...,x_n are formal variables (in which case this is an identity of rational functions) or specific positive reals (in which case it is a pointwise equality). (b) The range of t: is this for all t, or only t in (0,1)? At t=0 and t=1 there may be degeneracies. (c) Whether the identity holds at the polynomial level (F*_mu * P_lambda = f_mu * P*_lambda as polynomials) or only at the ratio level for x_i \u003e 0 where denominators are nonzero. These distinctions matter because the interpolation polynomials are characterized by vanishing conditions at SPECIFIC points (the spectral vector mu_tilde), and the identity might hold as polynomials (strong form) or only upon evaluation at generic points (weak form). The node must specify which form it claims.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
