Since λ has exactly n parts (one of which is 0), there are n-1 particles and 1 vacancy on n sites, completely filling the ring. This one-particle-per-site structure is essential for the bijection S_n(λ) ↔ configurations, and for the t-PushTASEP dynamics (Node 1.4) where every site has a well-defined occupant. Without this, the identification is ambiguous — one could imagine configurations with empty sites or multiple particles per site.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
