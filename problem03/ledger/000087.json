The claim 'stationary distribution of the t-PushTASEP is proportional to f_mu(x;q=1,t)' requires: (1) x_i \u003e 0 for all i (so rates 1/x_i are well-defined and positive), (2) t in [0,1) (so displacement probabilities (1-t) are positive, ensuring irreducibility), (3) lambda with distinct parts (the restricted partition condition from Node 1.1). At the boundary t=1, displacement never occurs and the chain becomes trivially reducible — the stationarity claim fails (or is vacuously true for every distribution). At t=0, the t-PushTASEP degenerates to ordinary PushTASEP, which is a valid case but has different properties. These domain restrictions are critical for the claim to be meaningful and must be stated explicitly.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
