This phrase is imprecise in multiple ways: (a) 'arrays of configurations' — what are the dimensions of the array? How many rows? What is a 'configuration' in this context? In FM07, the array has n rows for n species, each row being a configuration of a simpler exclusion process. In CMW22, multiline diagrams have a specific structure. The node gives no indication of what these arrays look like. (b) 'projects to the t-PushTASEP on the bottom row' — what does 'projects' mean? That the bottom row of the array, viewed as a configuration, evolves according to t-PushTASEP dynamics? Or that the marginal distribution of the bottom row under the multiline process's stationary distribution equals the t-PushTASEP's stationary distribution? These are different statements. The node should specify whether the projection is dynamical (the bottom row's induced dynamics IS the t-PushTASEP) or distributional (the bottom row's marginal MATCHES the t-PushTASEP stationary distribution).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
