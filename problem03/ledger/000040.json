The proof cites arXiv:2310.09740 but that paper is Ayyer-Martin (two authors, no Williams) about PushTASEP at t=0, NOT the t-PushTASEP with general parameter t. The correct paper for f_mu(x;q=1,t) as stationary weights of the t-PushTASEP should be verified — possibly arXiv:2403.10485 by Ayyer-Martin-Williams.
