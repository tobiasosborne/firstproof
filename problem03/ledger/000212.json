The probabilistic interpretation (item 6) requires t in (0,1) and x_i \u003e 0 for all i.\n\nREFERENCES. We adopt the notation of BDW25 (arXiv:2510.02587) throughout. Cross-paper notation correspondences are given below.\n\nNOTATION TABLE (BDW25 / AMW24 / CMW22):\n- E*_lambda: nonsymmetric interpolation Macdonald polynomial, characterized by vanishing conditions (KS96; BDW25 Thm 2.3). E*_mu is the unique polynomial of degree d = |mu| with leading coefficient [x^mu]E*_mu = 1 and E*_mu(nu~) = 0 for nu != mu with |nu| \u003c= d.\n- f*_mu (BDW25 Def 1.2): interpolation ASEP polynomial (algebraic), defined by f*_mu := T_{sigma_mu} E*_lambda, where T_{sigma_mu} is a product of Hecke generators. This is an INHOMOGENEOUS polynomial (has lower-degree terms).\n- F*_mu (BDW25 Def 1.14): interpolation ASEP polynomial (combinatorial), defined as a signed multiline queue weight-generating function.\n- f*_mu = F*_mu: BDW25 Theorem 1.15 (nontrivial equality of the algebraic and combinatorial definitions).\n- f_mu (BDW25) = F_eta (AMW24) = f_w (CMW22): homogeneous ASEP polynomial, defined as the top-degree homogeneous component of f*_mu (BDW25 Thm 2.3). WARNING: f_mu != f*_mu in general; f*_mu contains lower-degree correction terms.\n- P*_lambda (BDW25 Prop 2.15): interpolation Macdonald polynomial, satisfying P*_lambda = sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} f*_mu.\n- P_lambda (all papers): symmetric Macdonald polynomial, satisfying P_lambda = sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} f_mu. For INTERPOLATION polynomials this is BDW25 Prop 2.15; for HOMOGENEOUS polynomials this follows by extracting the top-degree component of both sides.\n\nCLAIMS:\n(1) f*_mu := T_{sigma_mu} E*_lambda (BDW25 Definition 1.2).\n(2) f*_mu = F*_mu (BDW25 Theorem 1.15).\n(3) f_mu := top-degree homogeneous component of f*_mu (BDW25 Theorem 2.3).\n(4) P*_lambda = sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} f*_mu (BDW25 Proposition 2.15).\n(5) P_lambda = sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} f_mu (follows from (4) by extracting top-degree parts; also AMW24 arXiv:2403.10485, Theorem 1.1).\n(6) At q=1, for t in (0,1), x_i \u003e 0: the f_mu(x;q=1,t) (equivalently F_eta in AMW24 notation) are stationary weights of the inhomogeneous multispecies t-PushTASEP on S_n(lambda), with P_lambda(x;q=1,t) as partition function (AMW24 arXiv:2403.10485, Theorem 1.1).\n\nNOTE: The bridge from interpolation ratios f*_mu/P*_lambda to homogeneous ratios f_mu/P_lambda is NOT established in this node; it is deferred to Node 1.6.","owner":"prover-s3-1.2"}
