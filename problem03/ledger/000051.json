A thorough literature review reveals:\n\n(1) BDW25 (arXiv:2510.02587) defines F*_mu via signed multiline queues with terms of BOTH signs (negative balls contribute -1/t^(n-1) at q=1). The paper does NOT prove nonnegativity at q=1.\n\n(2) BDW25 Section 1.4 explicitly defers the probabilistic interpretation of interpolation ASEP polynomials at q=1 to a forthcoming paper [BDW] by Ben Dali and Williams, which has NOT appeared as of February 2026.\n\n(3) CMW22 (arXiv:1811.01024) proves the multiline queue formula for HOMOGENEOUS Macdonald/ASEP polynomials (unsigned queues, manifestly positive). This does NOT extend to interpolation polynomials.\n\n(4) AMW24 (arXiv:2403.10485) proves f_mu(x;q=1,t)/P_lambda is the stationary distribution of the t-PushTASEP, giving nonnegativity of the HOMOGENEOUS f_mu. This says nothing about the interpolation f*_mu.\n\n(5) The Williams survey (arXiv:2202.00214) discusses positivity in Markov chains but predates the interpolation ASEP polynomial theory.\n\nIn short: the nonnegativity of F*_mu(x;q=1,t) for interpolation polynomials is, as of February 2026, an open question in the literature. The node treats it as established fact.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
