The correct paper for the claim that f_mu(x;q=1,t) are stationary weights of the t-PushTASEP with P_lambda(x;q=1,t) as partition function is arXiv:2403.10485 by Ayyer, Martin, AND Williams (2024), titled 'The inhomogeneous t-PushTASEP and Macdonald polynomials'. The node attributes a result to a paper that does not contain it.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
