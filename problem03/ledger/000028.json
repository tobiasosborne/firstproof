The node must state the precise consequence of the restriction: species labels lie in {0} ∪ {k ≥ 2}, creating a gap at 1 between vacancy (species 0) and the weakest particle species (≥2). Without a precise definition, this is vague handwaving in what should be a rigorous setup node.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
