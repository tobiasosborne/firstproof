However:\n\n(1) What happens at t=0? At t=0, the t-PushTASEP degenerates to the PushTASEP. The node should acknowledge whether the claim extends to t=0 or explain why t=0 is excluded.\n\n(2) What happens as t -\u003e 1? As t -\u003e 1, the pushing probability (1-t) -\u003e 0 and the chain becomes trivial. The stationary distribution should still be well-defined but the behavior may degenerate.\n\n(3) What about the boundary of the x_i domain? If some x_i -\u003e 0 or x_i -\u003e infinity, do the ratios F*_mu/P*_lambda remain well-defined?\n\nThese are minor issues compared to the positivity gap, but a complete treatment should address the domain boundaries.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
