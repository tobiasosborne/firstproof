But the node is NOT assuming the ratio identity — it is claiming to DERIVE it from the Hecke symmetrization relation. This is a logical proof step, not an assumption. The wrong inference type obscures the logical structure: if the ratio identity were truly assumed (as the inference type suggests), it would be an honest gap that the prover acknowledges needs external justification. By simultaneously classifying it as an 'assumption' and claiming it 'follows from' something, the node is incoherent — it both claims and disclaims a proof of the same statement. This matters because the ratio identity is THE crux of the entire proof (the bridge between the interpolation world of F*_mu/P*_lambda and the probabilistic world of f_mu/P_lambda), and misclassifying it as an assumption rather than a (failed) deduction hides the severity of the gap.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
