A transition in the t-PushTASEP moves particles between sites on the ring; the resulting configuration must still be a permutation of the parts of lambda. This requires showing that: (1) the pushing/cascade mechanism only REARRANGES particles among sites, never creating or destroying them, (2) a particle of species a that displaces a particle of species b \u003c a takes the position of b while b moves elsewhere — the net effect is a permutation of the species vector, not a change in the multiset of species. While this is indeed true for the actual t-PushTASEP (the cascade terminates at a vacancy and is a sequence of swaps), the node as stated does not argue this. Since S_n(lambda) = {permutations of (lambda_1,...,lambda_n)}, preservation means the multiset of species on the ring is invariant under transitions. This is a necessary property for the chain to be well-defined on S_n(lambda) and should be explicitly stated.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
