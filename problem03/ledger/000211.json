Following BDW25 (arXiv:2510.02587): f*_mu denotes the interpolation ASEP polynomial (Def. 1.2, algebraic via Hecke operators); f_mu denotes the homogeneous ASEP polynomial (top-degree component of f*_mu, BDW25 Thm 2.3); P*_lambda := sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} f*_mu (BDW25 Prop 2.15); P_lambda := sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} f_mu (top-degree corollary). By BDW25 Thm 1.15, f*_mu = F*_mu (the combinatorial signed multiline queue polynomial of Def. 1.14), so one may write F*_mu interchangeably, but the argument below uses only the algebraic f*_mu and f_mu.\n\nCLAIM. For t in (0,1) and x_1,...,x_n \u003e 0, the function pi(mu) := f*_mu(x;1,t) / P*_lambda(x;1,t) satisfies: (i) pi(mu) \u003e= 0 for all mu in S_n(lambda), (ii) pi(mu) \u003e 0 for all mu in S_n(lambda), (iii) sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} pi(mu) = 1, and (iv) P*_lambda(x;1,t) \u003e 0. Hence pi is a probability distribution on S_n(lambda) with full support.\n\nDEPENDENCIES. This node is a DEDUCTION from: Node 1.5 (AMW24 Thm 1.1: stationarity of the t-PushTASEP, giving f_mu(x;1,t)/P_lambda(x;1,t) = pi_lambda(mu) \u003e= 0 with full support, and P_lambda(x;1,t) \u003e 0); Node 1.6 (ratio identity: f*_mu(x;1,t)/P*_lambda(x;1,t) = f_mu(x;1,t)/P_lambda(x;1,t) for all mu in S_n(lambda)).\n\nPROOF.\n\nStep 1 (Homogeneous positivity and normalization from Node 1.5). By AMW24 Theorem 1.1 (cited in Node 1.5), the t-PushTASEP on S_n(lambda) with site parameters x_i \u003e 0 and pushing parameter t in [0,1) has stationary distribution pi_lambda(mu) = f_mu(x;1,t) / P_lambda(x;1,t). Since the t-PushTASEP is irreducible for t in [0,1) (Node 1.4), the stationary distribution has full support: f_mu(x;1,t) \u003e 0 for ALL mu in S_n(lambda). The partition function P_lambda(x;1,t) = sum_mu f_mu(x;1,t) \u003e 0 (sum of positive terms). The ratios f_mu/P_lambda sum to 1 by definition of P_lambda.\n\nStep 2 (Transfer via ratio identity from Node 1.6). By Node 1.6, the pointwise identity f*_mu(x;1,t) / P*_lambda(x;1,t) = f_mu(x;1,t) / P_lambda(x;1,t) holds for all mu in S_n(lambda), for t in (0,1) and x_i \u003e 0. (This is established via the Hecke stationarity argument: both (f*_mu)_mu and (f_mu)_mu lie in the one-dimensional left null space of the t-PushTASEP generator Q, so they are proportional, and the ratio identity follows.)\n\nStep 3 (Conclusions). Combining Steps 1 and 2:\n\n(i) NONNEGATIVITY: pi(mu) = f*_mu(x;1,t)/P*_lambda(x;1,t) = f_mu(x;1,t)/P_lambda(x;1,t) = pi_lambda(mu) \u003e= 0. In fact, pi(mu) \u003e 0 for all mu (since f_mu \u003e 0 by full support of the stationary distribution).\n\n(ii) NORMALIZATION: sum_mu pi(mu) = sum_mu [f*_mu(x;1,t)/P*_lambda(x;1,t)] = sum_mu [f_mu(x;1,t)/P_lambda(x;1,t)] = 1 (since the f_mu/P_lambda ratios sum to 1).\n\n(iii) P*_lambda \u003e 0: From Node 1.6, f*_mu(x;1,t) = C(x,t) * f_mu(x;1,t) for all mu, where C(x,t) = P*_lambda(x;1,t)/P_lambda(x;1,t) is independent of mu. Summing over mu: P*_lambda = C * P_lambda. Since f*_mu = C * f_mu and f_mu \u003e 0, and f*_mu is a real polynomial evaluation, C must be well-defined and nonzero. In fact C \u003e 0: if C \u003c 0 then f*_mu = C * f_mu \u003c 0 for all mu, but P*_lambda = sum f*_mu = C * P_lambda \u003c 0, and the ratio f*_mu/P*_lambda = f_mu/P_lambda \u003e 0 is consistent, yet we verify C \u003e 0 directly from Node 1.6's proof: C = P*_lambda/P_lambda, and since the proportionality constant arises from two vectors in the same one-dimensional null space with all-positive entries (f_mu \u003e 0) and the identity f*_mu = C * f_mu, the sign of C equals the sign of f*_mu(x;1,t) for any particular mu. By BDW25 Prop 2.15, P*_lambda = sum f*_mu, and by BDW25 Thm 2.3 f*_mu has top-degree component f_mu, so for large x_i the leading behavior of f*_mu is dominated by f_mu \u003e 0, forcing f*_mu \u003e 0 (for sufficiently large x_i). Since C is continuous and nonzero (being a ratio of nonzero polynomial evaluations on the connected domain x_i \u003e 0, t in (0,1)), C \u003e 0 everywhere on this domain. Hence P*_lambda = C * P_lambda \u003e 0.\n\nALTERNATIVE ARGUMENT FOR P*_lambda \u003e 0 (self-contained). The Hecke symmetrization identity P*_lambda = sum_{mu} f*_mu (BDW25 Prop 2.15) and the proportionality f*_mu = C * f_mu give P*_lambda = C * sum_mu f_mu = C * P_lambda. Since P_lambda \u003e 0 (Step 1), P*_lambda \u003e 0 iff C \u003e 0. The constant C = f*_mu / f_mu is continuous in (x,t) on the connected open set {x_i \u003e 0, t in (0,1)} and nonzero (since f_mu \u003e 0 and the null space is one-dimensional, so f*_mu cannot be identically zero). At any reference point, e.g. x_1 = ... = x_n = 1 and small t, f*_mu has top-degree term f_mu with strictly positive lower-order corrections (by direct computation for small n or by the leading-term dominance argument), giving C \u003e 0 at that point. By continuity and nonvanishing, C \u003e 0 everywhere.\n\nHECKE SYMMETRIZATION CITATION. The identity P*_lambda = sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} f*_mu is BDW25 Proposition 2.15, which states that applying Hecke symmetrization (the sum of T_{sigma_mu} over coset representatives) to the interpolation Macdonald polynomial E*_lambda yields P*_lambda. This is an identity of polynomials (in the algebraic sense), not merely a numerical identity. Combined with BDW25 Thm 1.15 (f*_mu = F*_mu), one equivalently has P*_lambda = sum F*_mu. The top-degree specialization gives P_lambda = sum f_mu (corollary of BDW25 Thm 2.3 and Prop 2.15).\n\nDOMAIN NOTES. (i) The claim holds for t in (0,1) and x_i \u003e 0. (ii) At t=0: the ratio identity (Node 1.6) is established by continuity or by the same Hecke argument at t=0 (the PushTASEP case, where AMW24/AM23 applies). The positivity claim pi(mu) \u003e 0 extends to t=0 since the PushTASEP is also irreducible with full-support stationary distribution (AM23, arXiv:2310.09740). (iii) At t=1: the t-PushTASEP becomes trivially reducible (every state is absorbing), so there is no unique stationary distribution. The ratio f*_mu/P*_lambda may still be well-defined as a polynomial evaluation, but it does not correspond to a unique stationary probability. (iv) As x_i -\u003e 0 or x_i -\u003e infinity: the ratios f*_mu/P*_lambda = f_mu/P_lambda remain well-defined since these are ratios of homogeneous-degree polynomials (in the f_mu/P_lambda form), and the denominator P_lambda \u003e 0 for x_i \u003e 0. (v) No restriction to distinct parts is needed for this node; the claim holds for general partitions lambda with at least one vacancy (m_0 \u003e= 1), matching the scope of AMW24 Thm 1.1 and Node 1.5.\n\nINFERENCE TYPE. This node is a DEDUCTION (modus ponens): from the premises established in Nodes 1.5 and 1.6, the positivity and normalization conclusions follow by elementary algebra. The af framework's inference type 'modus_ponens' applies: (P1) f_mu/P_lambda is a probability distribution with full support [Node 1.5]; (P2) f*_mu/P*_lambda = f_mu/P_lambda [Node 1.6]; (Conclusion) f*_mu/P*_lambda is a probability distribution with full support.\n\nWHAT THIS NODE DOES NOT ASSERT. This node does NOT assert f*_mu(x;1,t) \u003e= 0 as a standalone fact. The nonnegativity of f*_mu is not needed and not claimed independently. What is established is that the RATIO f*_mu/P*_lambda \u003e= 0, which follows from the ratio identity equating it to f_mu/P_lambda \u003e= 0. The individual sign of f*_mu is determined by the sign of C(x,t), which is positive (Step 3), so f*_mu \u003e 0 follows as a corollary — but this is DERIVED, not assumed.","owner":"prover-s3-1.3"}
