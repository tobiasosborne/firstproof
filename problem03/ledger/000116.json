This is factually wrong. The t-PushTASEP is NOT a nearest-neighbor process. When a clock rings at site i, the particle at site i scans clockwise past ALL sites with stronger-or-equal species until finding a strictly weaker one. This scan can traverse the ENTIRE ring — it is a long-range interaction, not a local one. Furthermore, the resulting cascade (the displaced particle must itself find an even weaker particle, and so on until a vacancy absorbs) involves global dynamics spanning potentially all n sites. Node 1.4's own challenges (ch-31ae7af3f1e664eb, ch-1ec04fc2163dd23b) explicitly identify that 'local species comparisons' is misleading for PushTASEP dynamics because the outcome of a single clock event depends on the species at potentially every site clockwise of i. The word 'adjacent' is especially wrong — the t-PushTASEP does NOT restrict interactions to adjacent particles. The node's argument structure ('local rates, therefore not described by global polynomials') collapses if the rates are themselves global.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
