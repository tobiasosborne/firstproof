However, the AMW24 paper (arXiv:2403.10485) uses the notation F_eta(x;q,t) (UPPERCASE F, NO asterisk) for the ASEP polynomials appearing as stationary weights. The node uses lowercase f_mu (no asterisk), which is the BDW25 convention. This creates confusion: in BDW25, f_mu is the homogeneous ASEP polynomial (top degree part of f*_mu), while F_eta in AMW24 appears to be the same object but with different notation. The node should clarify the notation mapping between these papers, or at minimum state which convention it adopts.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
