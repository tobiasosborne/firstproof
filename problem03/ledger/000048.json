In BDW25, Proposition 2.15 states P*_lambda = sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} f*_mu, where f*_mu is the algebraically-defined interpolation ASEP polynomial (via Hecke operators, Definition 1.2). The node writes F*_mu instead of f*_mu. In BDW25 notation, F*_mu is the COMBINATORIALLY-defined polynomial (via signed multiline queues, Definition 1.14). Their equality f*_mu = F*_mu is the main theorem (Theorem 1.15), NOT a definition.\n\nSo the summation P*_lambda = sum F*_mu is either: (1) Proposition 2.15 composed with Theorem 1.15 (a nontrivial chain of results), or (2) a direct corollary of Proposition 2.15 if one uses f*_mu notation. The node conflates these and calls it \"Hecke symmetrization\" without citing the specific proposition or acknowledging the theorem needed to translate between algebraic and combinatorial definitions.\n\nWhile this identity is likely correct (Proposition 2.15 of BDW25), the node should state it precisely and cite the source.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
