Ayyer-Martin (2310.09740) constructs a multiline Markov process only at t=0. AMW24 (2403.10485) proves the t-PushTASEP stationarity result via algebraic properties of nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials at q=1, NOT via a Ferrari-Martin multiline Markov process. No paper constructs a Ferrari-Martin-type multiline process for the t-PushTASEP at general t. The entire proof strategy of this node is based on a construction that does not exist in the literature.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
