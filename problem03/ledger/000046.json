The interpolation ASEP polynomials F*_mu (equivalently f*_mu in BDW25 notation) are defined via SIGNED multiline queues (BDW25, Theorem 1.15). In BDW25 Definition 1.11, negative balls contribute weight -q^(r-1)/t^(n-1), which at q=1 becomes -1/t^(n-1) -- a NEGATIVE quantity. So the multiline queue formula is a sum of terms with mixed signs, and nonnegativity at q=1 is NOT manifest from the combinatorial formula.\n\nThe only known route to nonnegativity of the HOMOGENEOUS ASEP polynomial f_mu(x;q=1,t) is through the probabilistic interpretation: f_mu/P_lambda is the stationary probability of state mu in the t-PushTASEP (AMW24), hence nonneg. But f_mu is the top-degree part of f*_mu, not f*_mu itself. Extending nonnegativity from f_mu to f*_mu requires establishing that F*_mu/P*_lambda = f_mu/P_lambda (Node 1.6), which is the hardest unproven step.\n\nThe handoff document flags this: \"positivity follows from the probabilistic interpretation (stationary probabilities are nonneg), but this is circular if we have not yet established that F*_mu/P*_lambda = f_mu/P_lambda.\"\n\nBDW25 Section 1.4 defers the probabilistic interpretation of interpolation ASEP polynomials at q=1 to a forthcoming paper [BDW] that has not appeared. This is an open mathematical question, not a settled fact.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
