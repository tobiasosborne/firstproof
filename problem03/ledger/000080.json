(Step B) This multiline process has product-form stationary distribution. (Step C) The marginal on the bottom row gives weights f_mu(x;q=1,t). Each of these is a nontrivial claim requiring either a theorem citation or a sub-proof. As shown in the companion challenges, Step A appears to be false for general t (the multiline Markov process construction exists only at t=0), Step B is false (no known multiline process has product-form distribution in this setting), and Step C conflates combinatorial formulas for ASEP polynomials with probabilistic marginals. The node presents no actual proof — it presents a proof sketch of a nonexistent proof. A correct version of this node would need to either: (1) cite the actual AMW24 theorem (Theorem 1.1 of arXiv:2403.10485) and state the actual proof method used there, or (2) decompose into subnodes that rigorously establish each step. As written, the node is an empty shell around a fictional proof strategy.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
