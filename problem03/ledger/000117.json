The node's argument is essentially: 'rates are local, F*_mu is global, therefore the chain is nontrivial.' This is an informal heuristic, not a mathematical proof. A rigorous proof of nontriviality must show that there is NO way to express the transition matrix entries P(mu -\u003e nu) using the F*_mu polynomials. This requires: (a) a formal definition of what 'described using' F*_mu means (is it that P(mu-\u003enu) cannot be written as a rational function of {F*_eta}? or that P(mu-\u003enu) is not a polynomial expression in F*_mu values? or something else?), and (b) a proof that no such expression exists. The node provides neither. In fact, it is entirely plausible that the transition probabilities CAN be expressed using F*_mu: since {F*_mu : mu in S_n(lambda)} are n\\!-many polynomials and the transition matrix has n\\!^2 entries, one could potentially find algebraic relations connecting them. The node does not rule this out. An appeal to 'locality vs globality' is not a rigorous mathematical exclusion argument.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
