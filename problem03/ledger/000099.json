But the node does NOT prove that F*_mu/P*_lambda satisfies the stationarity equations. This is exactly the gap flagged in the handoff: 'this requires proving that F*_mu/P*_lambda ALSO satisfies the stationarity equations — not just that it sums to 1.' The node ignores this requirement entirely. Proving that F*_mu/P*_lambda satisfies the balance equations of the t-PushTASEP is a nontrivial algebraic statement about how the Hecke operators T_i act on the interpolation polynomials F*_mu, and whether the Demazure-Lusztig relations yield the correct transition rates at q=1. The handoff's backup approach (Strategy C) suggests this might work via the transfer matrix eigenvector argument, but this would require a full sub-proof, not a one-line assertion.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
