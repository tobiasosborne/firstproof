Specifically: (a) It uses the relationship F*_mu = f_mu + lower-order terms, which is the polynomial identification from Node 1.2 (and ultimately from BDW25). (b) It implicitly needs f_mu/P_lambda to be a well-defined probability distribution (sum to 1, all nonneg), which comes from Node 1.5 (stationarity) and Node 1.3 (positivity/normalization). (c) It uses the Hecke symmetrization P*_lambda = sum F*_mu, which is also established in Nodes 1.2/1.3. Furthermore, the conclusion of Node 1.6 is needed by Node 1.3 (to establish positivity of F*_mu from positivity of f_mu), creating a circular dependency between 1.3 and 1.6 that the proof structure does not acknowledge.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
