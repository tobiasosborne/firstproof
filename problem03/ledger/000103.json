This section establishes a factorization property for interpolation Macdonald polynomials, which may be exactly the result needed to bridge interpolation and homogeneous polynomials at q=1. If BDW25 Theorem 7.1 proves that P*_lambda(x;q=1,t) = P_lambda(x;q=1,t) * C(x,t) for some universal factor C, and similarly f*_mu(x;q=1,t) = f_mu(x;q=1,t) * C(x,t) with the SAME factor C, then the ratio identity f*_mu/P*_lambda = f_mu/P_lambda would follow immediately by cancellation. However: (a) The node does not cite BDW25 Section 7 or Theorem 7.1 at all. (b) The node does not state the factorization result or verify that the factor is universal across compositions. (c) Even if the factorization exists, it requires verification that the factor is identical for f*_mu and P*_lambda = sum f*_nu, which is a nontrivial algebraic claim. The node must either cite and apply this specific result, or explain why it is not needed.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
