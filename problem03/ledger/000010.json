Each composition mu = (mu_1,...,mu_n) encodes the species of particle at site i, with 0 = vacancy. The restriction conditions (unique 0, no 1) ensure that vacancies and particle species are well-separated.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"d3748f7d082190dd940d6e5e9c2df9eb574b0e50c7e0b7841fdb24fa68870d83","created":"2026-02-09T21:50:49.904385047Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
