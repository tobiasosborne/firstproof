Each composition mu = (mu_1,...,mu_n) encodes the species of particle at site i, with 0 = vacancy. The restriction conditions (unique 0, no 1) ensure that vacancies and particle species are well-separated.","new_statement":"STATE SPACE SETUP (by_definition). Let λ = (λ_1 \u003e λ_2 \u003e ... \u003e λ_n ≥ 0) be a restricted partition with n distinct parts satisfying: exactly one part equals 0, and no part equals 1. The set S_n(λ) consists of all n\\! permutations (compositions) μ = (μ_1,...,μ_n) of (λ_1,...,λ_n). Each μ ∈ S_n(λ) is identified with a particle configuration on the ring Z_n = {1,...,n} with periodic boundary (site n+1 = site 1): site i is occupied by species μ_i. Species labels are {0} ∪ {k ≥ 2 : k ∈ λ}, with a gap at species 1. Species 0 is the vacancy (exactly one, since λ has exactly one 0); species k ≥ 2 are particles (n−1 of them). Every ring site has exactly one occupant. The natural total ordering 0 \u003c 2 \u003c 3 \u003c ... defines 'stronger' (larger species label) and 'weaker' (smaller species label) particles.","owner":"prover-s3-1.1"}
