The logical dependency is:\n\n(a) The homogeneous ASEP polynomial f_mu(x;q=1,t) \u003e= 0 follows from the probabilistic interpretation (Node 1.5: f_mu/P_lambda is a stationary probability of the t-PushTASEP).\n(b) To conclude F*_mu(x;q=1,t) \u003e= 0, one needs either: (i) a direct nonnegativity proof for the interpolation polynomial (which does not exist in the literature -- BDW25 defers this to an unpublished paper [BDW]), or (ii) the ratio identity F*_mu/P*_lambda = f_mu/P_lambda from Node 1.6, which would give F*_mu = (f_mu/P_lambda) * P*_lambda, making nonnegativity follow from f_mu \u003e= 0 and the sign of P*_lambda.\n\nNode 1.3 claims to be self-contained (\"this follows from... the nonneg of F*_mu at q=1\"), but in reality it depends on Nodes 1.5 and 1.6 at minimum. The proof has a circular dependency: 1.3 needs 1.6, and the overall conclusion needs 1.3. This dependency must be explicitly declared and the proof restructured.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
