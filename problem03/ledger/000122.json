But the node is not assuming nontriviality — it claims to ARGUE for it ('The t-PushTASEP rates are local... They are NOT described using... The chain is nontrivial'). This is a deduction (albeit a flawed one), not an assumption. The wrong inference type obscures the logical structure: if nontriviality were truly assumed, the proof would have an acknowledged gap at this point. By labeling a failed deduction as an 'assumption,' the severity of the logical deficiency is hidden.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
