What does 'well-separated' mean precisely? The restricted partition conditions (unique part 0, no part 1) ensure that the species labels form {0} ∪ {k ∈ Z≥2 : k = λ_i for some i}, so there is a gap at species label 1 between vacancy (0) and the minimum particle species (≥2). But 'well-separated' is vague — it could refer to species-label separation, spatial separation on the ring, or something else. The node must state the precise mathematical consequence of the restriction conditions.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
