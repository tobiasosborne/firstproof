But f_mu(x;q=1,t) is a POLYNOMIAL in x_1,...,x_n and t — a formal algebraic object. A marginal of a stationary distribution of a Markov process is a probability distribution — a collection of nonneg reals summing to 1. The node does not explain the mechanism by which a probability marginal produces a polynomial. In the actual literature (AMW24, CMW22), the connection works as follows: the ASEP polynomial f_mu (or F_eta in AMW24 notation) can be expressed as a sum of weights of multiline diagrams (CMW22, Theorem 1.1). Each multiline diagram contributes a weight that is a monomial in x_1,...,x_n times a power of t. This is a COMBINATORIAL formula, not a probabilistic marginal in the usual sense. The node conflates: (1) the combinatorial formula for f_mu as a weighted sum over multiline diagrams, with (2) a probabilistic marginal of a Markov process on multiline configurations. These are related but distinct concepts, and the node does not distinguish them or explain how one implies the other.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
