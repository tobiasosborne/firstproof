These are different polynomial families -- f*_mu is inhomogeneous (has lower-order terms), while f_mu is its top-degree homogeneous part. The node jumps from one to the other without any bridge. The relationship between F*_mu/P*_lambda and f_mu/P_lambda is supposedly handled in Node 1.6, but Node 1.2 does not even acknowledge the gap. A reader of Node 1.2 alone would think the Hecke formula directly gives stationary weights, which is false: T_{sigma_mu} E*_lambda gives the INTERPOLATION polynomial f*_mu, not the HOMOGENEOUS polynomial f_mu that appears in the stationarity result.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
