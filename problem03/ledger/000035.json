The node states 'with P_lambda(x;q=1,t) as partition function', meaning P_lambda(x;q=1,t) = sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} f_mu(x;q=1,t). While this is stated in the AMW24 abstract (arXiv:2403.10485), the node provides no theorem number, no argument, and no indication of whether this is a definition or a theorem. In BDW25, Proposition 2.15 proves P*_lambda = sum f*_mu for INTERPOLATION polynomials. The corresponding statement for HOMOGENEOUS polynomials P_lambda = sum f_mu would follow by taking top-degree parts, but this inference is not stated. The node must identify which result it relies on and from which paper.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
