We will give an interpolation analogue of this result in [BDW].' The reference [BDW] is a forthcoming paper by Ben Dali and Williams that has NOT appeared as of February 2026. The 'interpolation analogue' of the probabilistic interpretation would be precisely the statement that F*_mu(x;q=1,t)/P*_lambda(x;q=1,t) is the stationary distribution of some Markov chain — which is equivalent to the ratio identity this node claims to prove. The authors of the defining paper on interpolation ASEP polynomials consider this result significant enough to warrant a separate publication, yet Node 1.6 claims to establish it in a single sentence via an invalid argument. The node is asserting as trivially proved something that the experts in the field consider an open research result requiring a dedicated paper.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
