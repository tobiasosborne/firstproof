This is mathematically incorrect. F*_mu is the interpolation ASEP polynomial indexed by a COMPOSITION mu (an ordered tuple), not a partition. It is a NONSYMMETRIC polynomial — it is NOT invariant under permutation of the variables x_1,...,x_n. The symmetric Macdonald polynomial P_lambda is symmetric, but F*_mu is not. This is a fundamental distinction in the Macdonald polynomial literature: the nonsymmetric theory (indexed by compositions, related to Hecke algebras and Demazure-Lusztig operators) is categorically different from the symmetric theory (indexed by partitions, related to symmetric functions). Calling F*_mu a 'symmetric-function object' confuses the reader about the nature of these polynomials. The correct characterization is that F*_mu is a nonsymmetric polynomial in n variables that depends on the full composition mu (all n components in order), not merely the underlying partition.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
