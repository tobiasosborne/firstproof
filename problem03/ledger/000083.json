For a finite-state continuous-time Markov chain, uniqueness of the stationary distribution is equivalent to irreducibility of the chain. Irreducibility of the t-PushTASEP on S_n(lambda) is plausible for t in (0,1) — since any displacement that occurs at t=0 also occurs with positive probability at t in (0,1) — but this fact: (a) requires a proof or citation, (b) fails at t=1 where displacement never occurs and the chain is trivially reducible (every state is absorbing), (c) is not addressed in Node 1.4 (which has been challenged for this omission). Without uniqueness, the claim 'the stationary distribution is proportional to f_mu' is literally meaningless — there could be multiple stationary distributions, and f_mu/P_lambda might be only one of them. The node must either cite an irreducibility result or acknowledge that it is an additional hypothesis.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
