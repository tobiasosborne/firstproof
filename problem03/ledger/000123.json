But the ENTIRE PROOF (Nodes 1.5 and 1.6) establishes that the STATIONARY DISTRIBUTION of this very chain IS described using F*_mu: pi(mu) = F*_mu/P*_lambda. So the chain is intimately connected to F*_mu through its stationary distribution. The question then becomes: does the TRANSITION MATRIX also involve F*_mu, or is the connection only through the eigenvector (stationary distribution)? This is a subtle distinction that the node does not engage with at all. In the Hecke algebra framework (BDW25, Strategy C from HANDOFF.md), the Demazure-Lusztig operators T_i act on the F*_mu and produce the transition structure. The T_i operators define both the Hecke relations for F*_mu AND the transfer matrix of the chain. This means the chain's algebraic structure IS described using the same Hecke operators that define F*_mu. Whether this counts as being 'described using F*_mu' depends on the interpretation of the problem, but the node ignores this connection entirely.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
