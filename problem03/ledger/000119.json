The node takes this to mean that the transition rates are not literally equal to F*_mu evaluations. But 'described using' is ambiguous and could mean any of: (A) The transition matrix P(mu-\u003enu) cannot be written as P(mu-\u003enu) = F*_nu(x;q,t) for any single F*_nu. (B) The transition matrix entries are not polynomial functions of the values {F*_eta(x;q,t) : eta in S_n(lambda)}. (C) The transition matrix cannot be expressed as a matrix whose entries are rational functions of the F*_eta values. (D) The Markov chain is not 'the trivial chain' where P(mu-\u003enu) = pi(nu) for all mu (i.e., independent of the starting state). Interpretation (D) is arguably the most natural reading of 'nontrivial' — the trivial chain whose rows are all identical copies of the stationary distribution would literally have transition probabilities described by F*_mu/P*_lambda. The node does not discuss which interpretation is intended, and its argument (locality vs globality) does not rigorously establish any of them. A valid proof must first pin down what 'described using' means, then prove the chain fails that criterion.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
