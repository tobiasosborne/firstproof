The inference type should be something like \"deduction\" or \"external_theorem.\" More importantly, the argument is incomplete because the key premise (nonnegativity of F*_mu at q=1) is unproven.\n\nThe logical structure claimed is: (Premise 1) P*_lambda = sum F*_mu. (Premise 2) F*_mu \u003e= 0 at q=1. (Conclusion) pi(mu) = F*_mu/P*_lambda \u003e= 0 and sums to 1. This deduction is valid IF both premises hold. Premise 1 is BDW25 Prop 2.15 (correct). Premise 2 is an unproven assertion. The node presents the overall package as if it were self-evident, hiding the gap in Premise 2.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
