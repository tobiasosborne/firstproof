The Hecke formula gives f*_mu (interpolation, with lower-order terms), while AMW24's stationary weights are f_mu (homogeneous, top-degree only). These are mathematically different objects. The node jumps between them without acknowledgment. The bridge is deferred to Node 1.6, but Node 1.2 should at minimum flag this distinction explicitly.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
