BDW25 Example 1.16 provides an explicit formula for f*_{(0,2)}(x_1,x_2;q,t). At q=1, one can compute F*_{(2,0)}, F*_{(0,2)}, P*_{(2,0)}, and then check whether F*_{(2,0)}/P*_{(2,0)} = f_{(2,0)}/P_{(2,0)}. The node does not perform this elementary verification. For a claim that is (a) the hardest step in the proof, (b) flagged as high-risk by all three independent strategies, and (c) apparently an open research problem, a concrete n=2 example would be the absolute minimum due diligence. If the identity fails at n=2, the entire proof collapses. If it holds at n=2, it provides evidence (though not proof) for the general case and may reveal the mechanism behind the identity.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
