But the t-PushTASEP is defined in Node 1.4, which currently has 17 open challenges including critical ones: the cascade mechanism is omitted, the dynamics description is ambiguous, parameter domains are unspecified, and irreducibility is unaddressed. Node 1.5 makes no dependency declaration on Node 1.4, but it logically depends on having a well-defined Markov chain. If Node 1.4's definition is incomplete or incorrect (as its challenges argue), then the statement 'the stationary distribution of the t-PushTASEP' has no well-defined referent. Furthermore, Node 1.5 presupposes UNIQUENESS of the stationary distribution (by saying 'THE stationary distribution'), which requires irreducibility — something Node 1.4 has been challenged for not establishing.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
