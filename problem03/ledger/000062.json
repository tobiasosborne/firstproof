A continuous-time chain has a RATE MATRIX (generator matrix Q) whose rows sum to 0, not a transition matrix whose rows sum to 1. The node should either: (a) explicitly convert the continuous-time chain to a discrete-time chain via uniformization (embed in a Poisson process with total rate sum_i 1/x_i, then at each jump event choose site i with probability proportional to 1/x_i), or (b) state that the continuous-time chain's embedded discrete-time chain is the intended object, or (c) acknowledge that continuous-time stationarity implies discrete-time stationarity for the jump chain. Currently the node just says 'continuous-time Markov chain' without bridging to the discrete-time framework required by the problem.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
