This is false for every known multiline construction in this context. (a) FM07's construction for ordinary TASEP on Z uses independent product measures (arrival/service processes for M/M/1 queues), but the resulting stationary measure on multiline arrays is NOT a product measure over the array entries — it is a deterministic function of the independent inputs. On the ring Z_N, FM07's stationary measure is even more complex. (b) Ayyer-Martin (arXiv:2310.09740, Theorem 17) explicitly states that the stationary distribution of their multiline PushTASEP process is 'proportional to sums of weights of multiline diagrams.' This is NOT product-form; the weights involve complex combinatorial interactions between rows. The single-species case (Proposition 4) does factor, but the multispecies case does not. (c) CMW22's multiline queue weights involve intricate column-by-column interactions with parameters q and t — again, not product-form. The node's claim that a multiline process has 'product-form stationary distribution' is unsupported by any reference and appears to be fabricated. If the prover means something specific by 'product-form' (product over rows? over columns? over sites?), this must be stated precisely and cited.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
