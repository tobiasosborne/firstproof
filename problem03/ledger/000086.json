But the node is NOT assuming something is true — it is claiming to PROVE a result ('This is proved via...'). The stationarity of the t-PushTASEP with ASEP polynomial weights is an established theorem in the literature (Theorem 1.1 of AMW24, arXiv:2403.10485). The node should either: (a) invoke this as an external theorem (inference type 'external_theorem' or similar), citing the precise result, or (b) present a sub-proof decomposed into verified steps. The current inference type 'assumption' is wrong because the node explicitly provides a (flawed) proof sketch rather than positing an axiom.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
