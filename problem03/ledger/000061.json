In the actual t-PushTASEP (arXiv:2310.09740, Section 2), when a bell rings at a vacant site, NOTHING HAPPENS — the vacancy cannot push anything since there is no strictly weaker species (0 is the minimum). This is a required part of the transition rate definition. Without it, a reader might think every clock activation leads to a nontrivial transition, which would change the effective rate out of each state. Since lambda has exactly one part equal to 0 (restricted partition), there is exactly one vacancy on the ring, and its clock rings at rate 1/x_j but produces no state change. This affects the uniformization constant and hence the discrete-time transition matrix derived from the continuous-time chain.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
