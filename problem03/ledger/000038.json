While BDW25 Theorem 2.3 does use this terminology, E*_lambda is characterized by specific vanishing conditions: E*_mu is the unique polynomial in P_n^(d) with [x^mu]E*_mu = 1 and E*_mu(nu_tilde) = 0 for nu \\!= mu with |nu| \u003c= d. The node should at minimum reference these vanishing conditions or the Knop-Sahi characterization (KS96), since E*_lambda is not a standard universally-recognized notation (unlike E_mu for ordinary nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
