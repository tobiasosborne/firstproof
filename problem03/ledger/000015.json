Since F*_mu = f_mu + lower-order terms and P*_lambda = sum_mu F*_mu = P_lambda + lower-order terms, and both ratios sum to 1, the identity of ratios follows from the Hecke symmetrization relation.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"b1aa36e1870aea038df495f8d3ae351e06d24b171ca9e4a7792d2058f4513fbe","created":"2026-02-09T21:50:49.904417016Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
