For the rates 1/x_i to be well-defined, finite, and positive, we need x_i \u003e 0. For (1-t) to be a valid probability, we need t in [0,1]. For irreducibility (needed for unique stationary distribution in Node 1.5), we need t in [0,1) strictly — at t=1, displacement never occurs and the chain is trivially reducible (the identity). These constraints are critical: Nodes 1.3 (positivity), 1.5 (stationarity), and 1.7 (nontriviality) all depend on 1.4 having well-defined dynamics, which requires explicit parameter restrictions. The node should state: x_i \u003e 0 for all i, and t in [0,1) (or t in (0,1) if the t=0 PushTASEP case is to be excluded).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
