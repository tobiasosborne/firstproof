If the transfer matrix eigenvector argument works for f*_mu (not just f_mu), then f*_mu/P*_lambda satisfies the stationarity equations directly, and the ratio identity becomes a corollary of uniqueness. This is a plausible approach but requires verifying that the Hecke relations at q=1 translate to the correct Markov chain balance equations for the INTERPOLATION polynomials. (2) DIRECT VERIFICATION ROUTE: Show that the interpolation corrections g_mu = F*_mu - f_mu satisfy g_mu/f_mu = G/P_lambda (same proportional correction for each mu). This is equivalent to showing F*_mu = f_mu * (1 + G/P_lambda), where G = P*_lambda - P_lambda. This would follow from a factorization result like f*_mu(x;q=1,t) = f_mu(x;q=1,t) * C(x,t) where C is independent of mu. BDW25 Section 7 Theorem 7.1 may provide exactly this factorization. The node should have sub-refined into one of these approaches rather than asserting a one-line hand-wave.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
