In the literature: (a) CMW22 defines ASEP polynomials f_mu(x;q,t) depending on BOTH q and t, via multiline queue weights. (b) The t-PushTASEP is a Markov chain whose stationary weights are given by ASEP polynomials at q=1 specifically (AMW24, Theorem 1.1). But WHY q=1? What is special about q=1 for the t-PushTASEP? In the general ASEP (with both left and right hopping), the parameter q encodes the left/right asymmetry. At q=1, left and right rates are equal in the ASEP — but the t-PushTASEP is TOTALLY asymmetric (particles only move clockwise), so there should be no q-dependence at all. The node should explain why f_mu at q=1 (rather than general q) appears as the stationary weight. This is related to the fact that the t-PushTASEP can be viewed as a degeneration of the multispecies ASEP at q=1, but this connection is nontrivial and not stated. Without this explanation, a reader cannot understand why q=1 is the correct specialization.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
