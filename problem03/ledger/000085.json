However, AMW24 (arXiv:2403.10485) uses F_eta(x;q,t) (uppercase F, no asterisk) for the ASEP polynomials appearing as stationary weights, while BDW25 (arXiv:2510.02587) uses f_mu (lowercase f, no asterisk) for the homogeneous top-degree part of the interpolation ASEP polynomial f*_mu. These are claimed to be the same object but with different notation. The node uses BDW25's lowercase notation but attributes the stationarity result to papers (FM07, implicitly AMW24) that use different notation. This creates ambiguity about which mathematical object is actually meant. Furthermore, the node writes f_mu(x;q=1,t) with the explicit 'q=1' specialization, but this is confusing: if f_mu is already defined as the homogeneous ASEP polynomial at q=1, then writing q=1 is redundant. If f_mu is the general (q,t) ASEP polynomial, then the q=1 specialization is a substantive restriction that should be explained. The notation mapping between the papers used in this proof has never been established.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
