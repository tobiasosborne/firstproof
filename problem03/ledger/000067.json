The word 'local' is misleading for PushTASEP dynamics. In TASEP, interactions are nearest-neighbor (truly local). In PushTASEP, a single clock event at site i can trigger a cascade that moves particles across multiple sites around the entire ring — this is a LONG-RANGE interaction. The rate at which a clock rings at site i is 1/x_i (local), but the resulting transition involves a global scan of the ring configuration. The outcome of a clock event at site i depends on the species at potentially every site clockwise of i (to determine where the pushing particle settles and what cascade follows). This is not 'local' in any standard sense. The claim may be trying to express that the rates 1/x_i are site-specific, but the phrase 'local species comparisons' incorrectly suggests nearest-neighbor dynamics.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
