Node 1.2 references AMW24, and Node 1.5 references FM07, but Node 1.4 itself cites nothing. A construction node in a formal proof must cite exactly where the construction is defined. The relevant source appears to be Ayyer-Martin-Williams arXiv:2403.10485 (if the external reference AMW24 is corrected per challenges on Node 1.2), where the t-PushTASEP is defined. The node should cite the specific definition (e.g., 'Definition X.Y of [AMW24]') so the reader can verify that the informal description matches the formal definition. Without this, there is no way to check faithfulness of the construction to its source.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
