(since λ has n distinct parts, the number of distinct compositions/permutations is n!). This is a basic but important fact for the setup: it determines the size of the state space of the Markov chain. It also implicitly confirms the bijection with configurations is correct (n! arrangements of n distinct species on n ring sites, up to the ring labeling which is fixed since sites are labeled 1,...,n).","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
