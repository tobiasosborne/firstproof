The Hecke symmetrization in the literature provides two sum identities: (1) P*_lambda = sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} f*_mu (BDW25, Proposition 2.15), and (2) P_lambda = sum_{mu in S_n(lambda)} f_mu (top-degree corollary). These give the NORMALIZATION conditions sum(F*_mu/P*_lambda) = 1 and sum(f_mu/P_lambda) = 1. But the RATIO IDENTITY F*_mu/P*_lambda = f_mu/P_lambda for EACH individual mu is an enormously stronger statement than the sum identities. The ratio identity is equivalent to: F*_mu * P_lambda = f_mu * P*_lambda for all mu. Expanding: F*_mu * (sum_nu f_nu) = f_mu * (sum_nu F*_nu). This says sum_nu (F*_mu * f_nu - f_mu * F*_nu) = 0 for each mu. There is no Hecke symmetrization identity that implies this. The node must cite a specific theorem number from a specific paper, or provide a proof.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
