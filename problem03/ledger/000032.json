The node writes 'F*_mu(x;q,t) = T_{sigma_mu} E*_lambda' but BDW25 (arXiv:2510.02587) defines the interpolation ASEP polynomial as f*_mu (lowercase f with asterisk) via f*_mu := T_{sigma_mu} E*_lambda (Definition 1.2). The uppercase F*_mu in BDW25 denotes a different object: the weight-generating function for signed multiline queues (Definition 1.14). Theorem 1.15 of BDW25 then proves f*_mu = F*_mu, equating the algebraic and combinatorial objects. The node's equation F*_mu = T_{sigma_mu} E*_lambda conflates these two distinct definitions and presents a theorem (f*_mu = F*_mu) as a definition. While ultimately equivalent by Thm 1.15, writing it this way obscures the logical structure and misattributes the Hecke-operator definition to the combinatorial object.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
