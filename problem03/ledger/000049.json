The node never establishes that P*_lambda(x;q=1,t) \u003e 0 for t in (0,1) and x_i \u003e 0.\n\nBy Proposition 2.15 of BDW25, P*_lambda = sum_{mu} f*_mu. If some f*_mu could be negative (which is exactly the open question -- see the positivity challenge), then P*_lambda could in principle be zero or negative. Even if all f*_mu \u003e= 0, one needs at least one f*_mu \u003e 0 to ensure P*_lambda \u003e 0.\n\nFor the HOMOGENEOUS case: P_lambda = sum f_mu \u003e 0 follows from the probabilistic interpretation (it is the partition function of a well-defined Markov chain, hence positive). But for the INTERPOLATION case P*_lambda, this argument does not directly apply.\n\nIf one could establish the ratio identity (Node 1.6), then P*_lambda = P_lambda * (P*_lambda/P_lambda), and positivity of P*_lambda would follow if the ratio P*_lambda/P_lambda \u003e 0. But this requires additional work not present in the node.\n\nThe division by P*_lambda is undefined or meaningless unless P*_lambda \u003e 0 is proven.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
