At t=1, the t-PushTASEP becomes the identity chain (no displacement ever occurs), which is trivially nontrivial in the sense that its transition matrix P = I has no connection to F*_mu, but is trivial in the usual mathematical sense (the chain does nothing). At t=0, the chain degenerates to ordinary PushTASEP with different properties. The nontriviality claim should specify the parameter range, inheriting the restrictions from Node 1.4.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
