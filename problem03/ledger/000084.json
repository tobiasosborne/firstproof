A correct citation would be: 'Theorem 1.1 of Ayyer-Martin-Williams (arXiv:2403.10485)' — which is the actual result that establishes that stationary probabilities of the t-PushTASEP are proportional to ASEP polynomials F_eta(x;q=1,t) with partition function P_lambda(x;q=1,t). Instead, the node vaguely invokes 'the Ferrari-Martin multiline construction' without specifying which theorem from which paper is being used. The correct source (AMW24) is not even referenced in the node statement. This makes it impossible for a reader to verify the claim against the literature.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
