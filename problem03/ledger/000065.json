The node does not address irreducibility at all. In the t-PushTASEP with t in (0,1), the pushing particle may skip weaker particles (with probability t) or displace them (with probability 1-t). This means any transition that is possible at t=0 (ordinary PushTASEP) is also possible at t in (0,1), and additionally some long-range jumps become possible. But irreducibility requires that from ANY configuration mu in S_n(lambda), ANY other configuration nu in S_n(lambda) can be reached via a sequence of transitions with positive probability. This is plausible (the PushTASEP at t=0 is known to be irreducible for distinct species) but is a nontrivial fact that requires either a reference or a proof. It is especially important because the restricted partition conditions mean species are distinct (all parts of lambda are distinct), which is exactly the setting where irreducibility holds — but this connection should be made explicit.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
