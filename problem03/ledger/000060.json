Reading A: the particle at site i interacts with the particle at site i+1 (the ADJACENT site clockwise), and if that particle is weaker, displacement occurs. Reading B: the particle at site i scans clockwise past potentially many sites until it finds the FIRST site occupied by a strictly weaker species. The actual t-PushTASEP uses Reading B (confirmed by arXiv:2310.09740: 'particle moves to the first downstream location with a strictly weaker species'). But the node's phrasing 'pushes into the next weaker particle clockwise' could equally be parsed as 'pushes into the [particle at the] next [site] weaker [than it] clockwise,' which would be Reading B, or 'pushes into the next [i.e., adjacent] weaker particle clockwise,' which is Reading A. If a reader interprets this as nearest-neighbor interaction (Reading A), they get TASEP, not PushTASEP. The node must unambiguously specify that the pushing particle scans PAST all stronger-or-equal particles until a strictly weaker one is found, potentially wrapping around the ring.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
