# First Proof

> **WARNING: All proofs in this repository are adversarially generated by an AI system and MUST NOT be trusted.** No proof here should be considered valid unless it has been fully verified in Lean 4 against Mathlib. Until a machine-checkable proof compiles without `sorry` or custom axioms, treat every argument as potentially unsound.

## About

This repository tests the [`af` (Adversarial Proof Framework)](https://github.com/tobiasosborne/vibefeld) tool on the 10 research-level mathematics problems posed in the [*First Proof*](https://1stproof.org) paper by Abouzaid, Blumberg, Hairer, Kileel, Kolda, Nelson, Spielman, Srivastava, Ward, Weinberger, and Williams. The source paper is in [`docs/`](docs/).

### The First Proof Paper

*First Proof* is an experiment to assess the ability of current AI systems to correctly answer research-level mathematics questions. The paper presents 10 problems that arose naturally in the research of the authors, spanning algebraic combinatorics, spectral graph theory, algebraic topology, stochastic analysis, symplectic geometry, representation theory, lattices in Lie groups, tensor analysis, and numerical linear algebra. The answers are known to the authors but were encrypted and posted at [1stproof.org](https://1stproof.org), with public release scheduled for February 13, 2026.

Key features of the benchmark:
- Questions are sampled from the true distribution of problems working mathematicians encounter.
- Answers had never appeared on the internet or in any public forum prior to release.
- Each answer is a proof of roughly five pages or less.
- Preliminary tests by the authors indicate that frontier AI systems (GPT 5.2 Pro, Gemini 3.0 Deepthink) struggle with many of the problems in a single-shot setting.

### What This Repo Does

The `af` tool uses an adversarial prover/verifier protocol to decompose conjectures into proof trees. An AI agent proposes proof steps, and a separate agent attempts to find flaws. **This process is heuristic and fallible** — the adversarial structure reduces but does not eliminate the risk of unsound arguments.

This repo is a test bed for `af` on hard, real-world mathematical problems whose answers are independently verifiable.

## Repository Structure

```
docs/              Source paper (First_Proof.tex)
problem01/         Problem statement + af proof tree
problem02/         ...
  ...
problem10/         ...
```

Each `problemNN/` folder contains:
- `problem.md` — LLM-readable problem statement
- `ledger/` — `af` proof tree (JSON node files)

## Trust Model

**Do not cite, rely on, or reproduce any proof from this repository as correct mathematics.**

The only path to trust is:
1. Formalize the proof in Lean 4 with Mathlib.
2. Compile with zero `sorry` statements and no custom axioms.
3. Run `lake build` successfully.

Everything else — natural-language arguments, proof sketches, `af` node judgments — is **unverified conjecture** regardless of how convincing it may appear.
