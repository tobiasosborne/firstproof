# First Proof

> **WARNING: All proofs in this repository are adversarially generated by an AI system and MUST NOT be trusted.** No proof here should be considered valid unless it has been fully verified in Lean 4 against Mathlib. Until a machine-checkable proof compiles without `sorry` or custom axioms, treat every argument as potentially unsound.

## About

This repository tests the [af (Adversarial Proof Framework)](../vibefeld) tool on the 10 research-level mathematics problems posed in the *First Proof* paper (Abouzaid, Blumberg, Hairer et al.). The source paper is in [`docs/`](docs/).

The `af` tool uses an adversarial prover/verifier protocol to decompose conjectures into proof trees. An AI agent proposes proof steps, and a separate agent attempts to find flaws. **This process is heuristic and fallible** — the adversarial structure reduces but does not eliminate the risk of unsound arguments.

## Repository Structure

```
docs/              Source paper (First_Proof.tex)
problem01/         Equivalence of the Phi^4_3 measure under smooth shifts (Hairer)
problem02/         ...
  ...
problem10/         ...
```

Each `problemNN/` folder contains:
- `problem.md` — LLM-readable problem statement
- `ledger/` — `af` proof tree (JSON node files)

## Trust Model

**Do not cite, rely on, or reproduce any proof from this repository as correct mathematics.**

The only path to trust is:
1. Formalize the proof in Lean 4 with Mathlib.
2. Compile with zero `sorry` statements and no custom axioms.
3. Run `lake build` successfully.

Everything else — natural-language arguments, proof sketches, `af` node judgments — is **unverified conjecture** regardless of how convincing it may appear.
