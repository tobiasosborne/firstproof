But this node is NOT a hypothesis -- it is a DERIVED CLAIM. The node takes as INPUT: (a) pi is supercuspidal with c(pi) \u003e= 1 (from the parent's case split), (b) the torus sum formula from the parent node 1.4.4, (c) the Kirillov model characterization of supercuspidals (Bernstein-Zelevinsky), (d) the Matringe torus support formulas, (e) the W^circ dominance condition. From these inputs, it DERIVES the conclusion that the torus sum collapses to a single term.\n\nThis is a derivation (likely modus_ponens or a chain of universal_instantiation + modus_ponens), not an assumption. The inference type should be changed accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, the node has NO DECLARED DEPENDENCIES, but it implicitly depends on: (1) Node 1.4.4 (parent, for the torus sum formula), (2) Node 1.5 (cited for J_K(0,...,0) != 0), (3) External references: Matringe 2013, Bernstein-Zelevinsky, Jacquet-Shalika, Matringe-Miyauchi. All of these should be declared as formal dependencies.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
