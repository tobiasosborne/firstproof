Yet 1.1 is not listed as a dependency. The commutation identity is essential for interpreting R(u_Q)W^circ as the Whittaker function with the additive twist psi^{-1}(Q g_{nn}).\n\n(2) Node 1.5.1 is explicitly invoked in Step 4: 'the leading term (m = 0) has W^circ(I_{n+1}) * J_K(0) != 0 (by Node 1.5.1 logic).' Yet 1.5.1 is not listed as a dependency. If Step 4 relies on any result from Node 1.5.1, this dependency must be declared — both because the logic must be traceable and because Node 1.5.1 has open challenges that should taint Node 1.5.2 via the dependency chain.\n\nCurrent declared dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.4.4.2.\nShould be: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.4.4.2, 1.5.1.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
