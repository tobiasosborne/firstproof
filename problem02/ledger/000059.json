Hence psi(Q varpi^{m_n} x) is trivial for all x in o. Since k_{nn} in o for k in K_n, the twist psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} k_{nn}) = 1 for all k in K_n. The K-integral becomes J_K(m) = int_{K_n} V^circ(ak) dk. This equals the K_n-average of the right translate of V^circ, i.e., the projection of V^circ onto the space of right-K_n-invariant functions. For ramified pi with c(pi) \u003e= 1, the conductor exponent is the minimal c \u003e= 0 such that pi^{K_1(p^c)} is nonzero. Since c(pi) \u003e= 1, we have pi^{K_n} = pi^{K_1(p^0)} = 0 (the zero subspace). Therefore the K_n-average of any vector in W(pi, psi), including V^circ, vanishes: int_{K_n} V^circ(ak) dk = 0 for all a. Hence J_K(m) = 0 when m_n \u003e c(pi).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"d256a2ddc1bdeca0338263ccac1ac99a04400433b0bc0584636adf74bdd57d64","created":"2026-02-09T13:23:37.853926785Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
