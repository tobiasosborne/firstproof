The node begins with phi_0 = char(o^{n-1} \\ p*o^{n-1}), the characteristic function of vectors in o^{n-1} with AT LEAST ONE unit coordinate. All intermediate analysis (steps (i)-(iv), the n \u003e= 2 case) uses this definition. In particular, the deduction m_{n-1} = 0 (from 'at least one coordinate is a unit') is specific to this set.\n\nHowever, the node then discovers that char(o^{n-1} \\ p*o^{n-1}) does not force all m_i = 0 for n \u003e= 3 (only m_{n-1} = 0 is forced), so it switches to phi_0 = char((o^x)^{n-1}), the characteristic function of vectors with ALL coordinates units. The AMENDED DEFINITION at the end retroactively changes Node 1.3.1.\n\nThe two sets are different: o^{n-1} \\ p*o^{n-1} != (o^x)^{n-1} for n \u003e= 3. The first contains vectors like (varpi, 1) (one unit suffices); the second requires all coordinates to be units. So the intermediate analysis was performed with the WRONG function, and the conclusions drawn from that function's support do not directly transfer to the amended function.\n\nWhile this could be fixed by starting with the amended definition phi_0 = char((o^x)^{n-1}) from the beginning, as currently written, the proof is incoherent: it derives consequences from one function's support, discovers those consequences are insufficient, then retroactively changes the function without re-deriving the intermediate steps.\n\nA clean version should: (1) define phi_0 = char((o^x)^{n-1}) from the outset, (2) verify all intermediate steps with this definition, and (3) not include the dead-end analysis with the old definition.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
