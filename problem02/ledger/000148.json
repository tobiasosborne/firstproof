By fiber decomposition over k_{nn} mod p^{c(pi)-m_n} and orthogonality of additive characters, J_K(m) = 0.'\n\nThe phrase 'fiber decomposition over k_{nn} mod p^{c(pi)-m_n}' implicitly assumes that the integrand can be organized by the value of k_{nn} modulo p^{c-m_n}. But c - m_n \u003e c = val(q), so p^{c-m_n} is strictly contained in q = p^c. This means k_{nn} mod p^{c-m_n} is a FINER decomposition than k_{nn} mod q. The integrand (specifically V^circ(ak)) is K_1(q)-invariant but NOT K_1(p^{c-m_n})-invariant (since K_1(p^{c-m_n}) is strictly larger than K_1(q) when m_n \u003c 0). So the fiber decomposition at the p^{c-m_n} level cannot factor out V^circ as constant on fibers.\n\nThe correct argument (as detailed in the previous challenge and in open challenge ch-5ae3ea35e51 on Node 1.4.3) is to average over K_1(q) first: the inner K_1(q)-integral of the twist vanishes because psi(Q varpi^{m_n} *) is nontrivial on p^c. This argument does not require any fiber decomposition at the finer level p^{c-m_n}.\n\nThe conclusion J_K(m) = 0 for m_n \u003c 0 is correct, but the stated mechanism (fiber decomposition over k_{nn} mod p^{c-m_n} plus character orthogonality at this fine level) is not rigorous as written. The node either needs to give the correct K_1(q)-averaging argument, or explicitly defer to a child node that does.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
