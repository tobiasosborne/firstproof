The external references should be declared or verified.\n\n(2) INFERENCE TYPE: Listed as 'assumption' but node 1.4.4 is performing a DERIVATION: it takes the formula for I(s) with m_n = 0 fixed (from parent/1.4.3), applies JPSS rationality, and argues the monomial property via pole/zero analysis. This is a computational/logical derivation from prior results and external theorems, not a global hypothesis or axiom. The inference type should be changed to reflect this.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
