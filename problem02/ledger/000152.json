The node text was amended to include 'DEPENDENCIES: Node 1.1 (commutation identity), Node 1.3 (test vector choices W = W^circ, V = V^circ for ramified pi)' in the body, but af deps 1.4 still returns 'No dependencies.' The textual acknowledgment is a partial fix, but the formal dependency links should be registered so that taint propagation and dependency tracking work correctly. Additionally, the inference type remains 'assumption' though this node performs a derivation/computation from prior results.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
