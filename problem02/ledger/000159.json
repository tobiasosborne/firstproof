Explicit counterexample: P(z) = 1 + z satisfies P(q^{-1/2}) != 0 but P(-1) = 0. A Laurent polynomial of degree \u003e= 1 always has zeros on C* (fundamental theorem of algebra). So 'nonzero at one point' cannot distinguish a monomial from a multi-term polynomial.\n\nAdditionally, challenge ch-20cf2e255b797120 [major, open] shows that even the nonvanishing at s = 1/2 is illegitimate: it invokes 'Node 1.5.1 logic' for non-supercuspidal pi, but Node 1.5.1 is exclusively about supercuspidal pi and itself has 3 open challenges.\n\nNode 1.6 does not provide any independent argument for the epsilon factor identification. It simply defers entirely to Node 1.5.2, which is doubly broken. Case 3 is therefore unestablished.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
