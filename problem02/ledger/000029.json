This is FALSE for n \u003e= 2. The conductor analysis in cases (a)-(c) constrains ONLY the last torus coordinate m_n: case (c) selects m_n = 0 (since val(Q) = -c(pi) and val(Q varpi^{m_n}) = -c(pi) forces m_n = 0). But the torus A_n is parameterized by (m_1, ..., m_n) in Z^n, and the remaining coordinates m_1, ..., m_{n-1} are UNCONSTRAINED by the conductor analysis.\n\nAfter fixing m_n = 0, the integral still contains a sum over (m_1, ..., m_{n-1}) in Z^{n-1}:\n\n  Sum_{m_1,...,m_{n-1}} delta_B^{-1}(a) |det a|^{s-1/2} W^circ(diag(a,1)) * G(a)\n\nwhere a = diag(varpi^{m_1}, ..., varpi^{m_{n-1}}, 1) and G(a) is the K-integral. For this to be a monomial in q^{-s}, either (i) only one tuple (m_1,...,m_{n-1}) contributes, or (ii) the sum miraculously yields a monomial. Neither is argued.\n\nThe HANDOFF.md itself flags this at line 74: 'Known vulnerability: The torus-sum collapse may not be as clean for general n as it is for n = 1. For general n, the support properties of W^circ and V^circ on the torus (Matringe-Miyauchi formulas) must be invoked carefully.'\n\nCONCRETE COUNTEREXAMPLE SKETCH for GL_3 x GL_2 (n=2): Fix m_2 = 0 by the conductor analysis. The sum over m_1 involves W^circ_Pi(diag(varpi^{m_1}, 1, 1)) * (K-integral at a=(varpi^{m_1},1)) * delta_B^{-1} * q^{-m_1(s-1/2)}. For a ramified principal series pi = chi_1 x chi_2 on GL_2 with c(pi) \u003e= 1, the Matringe-Miyauchi support conditions give nonzero values of V^circ at (m_1, 0) for multiple m_1 \u003e= 0 (the support is not a single point). Similarly, W^circ for Π on GL_3 has nonzero torus values at (m_1, 0, 0) for m_1 in a half-line. The product gives multiple contributing terms, yielding a Laurent polynomial in q^{-s}, NOT a monomial. The node's conclusion 'yielding a monomial' is therefore unjustified for n \u003e= 2.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
