But the children do NOT prove 'I(s) has no poles' via the parent's framework. Instead:\n\n- 1.4.4.1 (supercuspidal): Proves the torus sum collapses to a SINGLE TERM m = 0. The integral I(s) = W^circ(I_{n+1}) * J_K(0,...,0) is a nonzero CONSTANT. It is trivially a monomial. There is no need for the rationality + pole/zero analysis framework at all -- the monomial property follows immediately from single-term collapse + nonvanishing.\n\n- 1.4.4.2 (non-supercuspidal): Proves the torus sum is FINITE, giving I(s) as a finite Laurent polynomial. Then attempts to identify I(s) with the epsilon factor epsilon(s, Pi x pi, psi) (a monomial), but this identification is 'the subject of ongoing work.' The alternative is a modified test vector V_mod whose construction is deferred. Neither strategy matches the parent's 'no poles + no zeros' framework.\n\nThe parent's framework would work IF both children proved 'I(s) has no zeros on C*' (the pole part is automatic from finiteness). But neither child proves this. Child 1.4.4.1 sidesteps it via single-term collapse. Child 1.4.4.2 attempts to sidestep it via epsilon factor identification (incomplete).\n\nThe parent node should be restructured to correctly state what each child is doing:\n(1) Supercuspidal case: torus collapse to single term -\u003e I(s) is a nonzero constant.\n(2) Non-supercuspidal case: EITHER epsilon factor identification (I(s) = C * epsilon, hence monomial) OR modified test vector V_mod giving single-term collapse. Currently, both are incomplete.\n\nThe zero analysis should NOT be argued at the parent level (the sign structure argument is mathematically invalid, per the critical challenge). The parent should either (a) delegate zero analysis entirely to children, or (b) present a correct unified argument (none is given).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
