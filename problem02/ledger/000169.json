Node 1.3 defers the general n \u003e= 2 unramified case to children 1.3.1 and 1.3.2, but does not declare explicit dependencies on any other nodes. It should declare dependencies on:\n\n(1) The Matringe-Miyauchi essential Whittaker function theory (external reference \"Matringe essential Whittaker\" and \"Miyauchi newforms\") for the claim W^circ(I_{n+1}) != 0.\n(2) The Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory for the Kirillov model embedding S(F^{n-1}\\{0}) -\u003e K(pi, psi).\n\nAdditionally, the structural relationship between 1.3 and its children is poorly specified: Node 1.3 claims \"the integral is a nonzero monomial in q^{-s}\" for the unramified case but defers all substance to 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. The parent thus makes a claim whose truth depends entirely on the children, yet the children (1.3.1 and 1.3.2) both have multiple open critical challenges (3 on 1.3.1, 4 on 1.3.2) including the K-projection dilemma (ch-8a091889d3a on 1.3.2) which, if upheld, would refute the entire unramified case strategy. The parent should note that its Case 2 claim is conditional on resolution of these child challenges.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
