But Humphries (2021) is primarily about GL_2, and Assing-Blomer (2024) does not establish this identity in the generality needed. The twist R(u_Q) is a unipotent translation, NOT an Atkin-Lehner involution, and the identification of this specific twisted integral with the epsilon factor requires a non-trivial theorem that is not in the cited literature for GL_{n+1} x GL_n with n \u003e= 2. Node 1.4.4.2 itself acknowledges this is 'the subject of ongoing work.'\n\n(2) ch-97707406023 (critical, gap): STEP 4 of 1.5.2 (the 'alternative self-contained argument') commits a fundamental logical error: it argues I(s) is a monomial because I(1/2) != 0, but nonvanishing at one point does NOT imply a Laurent polynomial has no zeros. Explicit counterexample: P(z) = 1 + z is a Laurent polynomial with P(q^{-1/2}) != 0 but P(-1) = 0.\n\n(3) ch-20cf2e255b7 (major, gap): Step 4 invokes 'Node 1.5.1 logic' for non-supercuspidal pi, but Node 1.5.1 is explicitly about supercuspidal pi only. The representation-theoretic structure (cuspidal vs. non-cuspidal restriction to GL_n(F_q)) is fundamentally different.\n\nCONSEQUENCE: Both proof paths in Node 1.5.2 fail. The epsilon-factor identification path (Step 3) cites literature that does not cover the needed case. The alternative path (Step 4) contains a logical error. The parent node 1.5 therefore has NO valid argument for Case B.\n\nMoreover, Case B is arguably the harder case. For supercuspidal pi, the sum collapses to one term, so nonvanishing reduces to two pointwise evaluations (NV1 and NV2). For non-supercuspidal pi, the sum has MULTIPLE terms, and one must show either (a) the sum is a monomial (requires the epsilon-factor identification), or (b) the sum is nonzero (requires controlling cancellation among terms). Neither is achieved.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
