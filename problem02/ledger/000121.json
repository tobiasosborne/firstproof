But the node is NOT postulating a hypothesis -- it claims to DERIVE the nonvanishing J_K(0,...,0) != 0 from prior results (Nodes 1.3, 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.4.1) and external references (Matringe 2013, Miyauchi 2014). The four-step argument (reduction to finite sum, fiber decomposition, evaluation, conclusion) is a purported derivation, not an assumption.\n\nThe inference type should reflect the actual logical role: this is a derivation (or attempted derivation) from the listed dependencies, not a standalone assumption.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
