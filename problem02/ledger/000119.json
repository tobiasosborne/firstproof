The justification conflates two different conditions:\n\n(A) CORRECT: If the ENTIRE last row of a matrix bar-k in M_n(o/q) lies in p/q (i.e., every entry of the last row is a non-unit), then det(bar-k) is in p/q (expanding along the last row, each cofactor is multiplied by an element of p/q), so bar-k is NOT in GL_n(o/q).\n\n(B) FALSE: If only bar-k_{nn} is a non-unit, but some other entry bar-k_{nj} (j \\!= n) in the last row is a unit, then the matrix CAN still be invertible.\n\nEXPLICIT COUNTEREXAMPLE: For n = 2, q = p (i.e., c(pi) = 1), consider the matrix bar-k = [[1, 0], [1, 0]] in M_2(F_q). This is singular (det = 0). But [[0, 1], [1, 0]] has det = -1, which is a unit in F_q (for q odd; for q = 2, det = 1). The (2,2)-entry is 0, a non-unit. So the fiber F_0 in GL_2(F_q) is NONEMPTY.\n\nMore generally, for any n \u003e= 2, the permutation matrix corresponding to the transposition (n-1, n) lies in GL_n(o/q), has determinant -1, and has bar-k_{nn} = 0. So F_0 is always nonempty for n \u003e= 2.\n\nCOUNTING THE NON-UNIT FIBERS: For n = 2 over F_q, the number of matrices in GL_2(F_q) with bar-k_{22} = x is:\n- For x in F_q^x: |GL_2(F_q)|/q * (some factor) -- substantial.\n- For x = 0: the matrices [[a, b], [c, 0]] with -bc in F_q^x, so b in F_q^x, c in F_q^x, a in F_q. This gives q(q-1)^2 matrices. Since |GL_2(F_q)| = (q^2-1)(q^2-q) = q(q-1)^2(q+1), the fraction of GL_2(F_q) with bar-k_{22} = 0 is q(q-1)^2 / (q(q-1)^2(q+1)) = 1/(q+1), which is substantial.\n\nCONSEQUENCE: The correct formula for J_K(0) involves a sum over ALL of o/q:\n\nJ_K(0) = vol(K_1(q)) * sum_{x in o/q} psi^{-1}(Qx) * Phi(x)\n\nwhere Phi(x) = sum_{bar-k in GL_n(o/q), bar-k_{nn}=x} V^circ(lift(bar-k)), and the sum includes non-unit values of x.\n\nThis matters because:\n(1) sum_{x in o/q} psi^{-1}(Qx) = 0 by character orthogonality (since psi^{-1}(Q*-) is nontrivial on o/q). So the nonvanishing of the full sum depends entirely on Phi(x) NOT being constant across fibers.\n(2) The non-unit fibers contribute to the sum and can affect whether cancellation occurs. The nonvanishing analysis must account for Phi(x) at ALL x in o/q, not just units.\n(3) The phrase \"for the generic case\" in the node is mathematically meaningless as a justification -- a proof must work for ALL supercuspidal pi of GL_n with c(pi) \u003e= 1, not \"generically.\"","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
