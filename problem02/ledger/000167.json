In Case 2 (unramified pi, c(pi) = 0), the node defers the general n \u003e= 2 case to children 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. Those children (especially 1.3.2) use the factorization W^circ(diag(ak,1)) = W^circ(diag(a,1)) by claiming diag(k,1) in K_1(p^{c(Pi)}) for all k in GL_n(o). This factorization is correct (verified in Node 1.4.1). However, the children then invoke the Casselman-Shalika formula for W^circ on the GL_{n+1}-torus to constrain the support to dominant weights m_1 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_n \u003e= 0. The Casselman-Shalika formula applies ONLY when Pi is unramified (c(Pi) = 0), where W^circ is the spherical Whittaker function.\n\nFor ramified Pi (c(Pi) \u003e= 1), W^circ is the new vector, NOT the spherical vector. Its torus support is described by Matringe 2013 and Miyauchi 2014, but is NOT necessarily restricted to the dominant cone. This means the torus collapse argument in 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 (which relies on the intersection of \"m_i \u003c= 0 from V_0-support\" and \"m_i \u003e= 0 from W^circ Casselman-Shalika\") fails for ramified Pi. Since Node 1.3 claims the construction works for ALL Pi, this is a gap that propagates from children to the parent.\n\nThe parent node should explicitly note that the unramified case construction depends on the torus support of W^circ, and either: (a) restrict the Casselman-Shalika argument to unramified Pi and provide a separate argument for ramified Pi, or (b) cite a generalization of the support condition valid for all generic Pi.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
