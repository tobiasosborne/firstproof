The K-integral becomes:\n\n  W^circ(diag(a,1)) * int_{K_n} V^circ(ak) dk\n\nThe vanishing argument requires two unstated steps:\n\n(A) W^circ(diag(ak,1)) = W^circ(diag(a,1)) for all k in K_n, so W^circ factors out. This holds because diag(k,1) in GL_{n+1}(O) has last row (0,...,0,1), which lies in K_1(p^c) for any c, hence W^circ (which is K_1(p^{c(Pi)})-fixed) is invariant under right multiplication by diag(k,1). This crucial observation is never stated.\n\n(B) int_{K_n} V^circ(ak) dk = [P_K V^circ](a) = 0 where P_K is the projection onto K-fixed vectors in the Whittaker model of pi. For ramified pi (c(pi) \u003e= 1), the space pi^K = 0 (by definition of conductor: c(pi) is the minimal c with pi^{K_1(p^c)} nonzero, so c(pi) \u003e= 1 implies pi^{K_1(1)} = pi^K = 0). Therefore P_K V^circ = 0, giving vanishing.\n\nThe node should state these steps explicitly rather than just citing 'orthogonality for ramified pi.'","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
