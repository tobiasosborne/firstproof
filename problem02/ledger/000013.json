The additive twist psi^{-1}(Q a_n k_{nn}) from Node 1.1, combined with K_1(q)-invariance of V^circ, produces a K-integral that is a generalized Gauss sum. Conductor-level analysis shows: (a) when val(Q varpi^{m_n}) \u003e 0, the twist is trivial and the K-integral vanishes by orthogonality for ramified pi; (b) when val(Q varpi^{m_n}) \u003c -c(pi), oscillation is too rapid and the K-integral vanishes by cancellation; (c) when val(Q varpi^{m_n}) = -c(pi), the conductors match and the K-integral equals a nonzero Gauss sum. Only case (c) contributes, so the torus sum collapses to a single coset, yielding a monomial.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"913823eabc4e32fe737a114d3edd00f66e702e7253d08545b44f73f97847f015","created":"2026-02-09T11:55:04.170928783Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
