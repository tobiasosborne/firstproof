The node was amended to include a textual DEPENDENCIES paragraph listing nodes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5. However, the af system still shows 'Dependencies: (none)' in the node metadata, meaning the formal dependency declarations were never added. The textual paragraph is not a substitute for formal dependency declarations because:\n\n(1) TAINT PROPAGATION IS BROKEN: The af framework propagates taint through formal dependency edges. Without these edges, node 1.6 does not inherit the taint from its upstream nodes. Currently, nodes 1.3, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.4.3, 1.4.4, 1.4.4.1, 1.4.4.2, 1.5.1, and 1.5.2 collectively carry 20+ open challenges including 6 critical-severity challenges. Node 1.6 should be tainted by ALL of these, but is not.\n\n(2) INFERENCE TYPE REMAINS 'assumption': The node inference type is 'assumption' (global hypothesis), but a QED node assembling results from five upstream branches is a DERIVATION, not an assumption. The inference type must be changed.\n\n(3) THE RESOLVED STATUS OF ch-4d813d85920075e5 IS PREMATURE: That challenge was resolved by adding a textual paragraph, but the actual structural defect persists.\n\nRequired fix: Add formal af dependency declarations for nodes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, AND change the inference type from 'assumption' to an appropriate derivation type.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
