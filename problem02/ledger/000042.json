It explicitly references every upstream node:\n\n(1) Node 1.1: 'Combining Nodes 1.1-1.5' -- the commutation identity is needed for the integral reduction.\n(2) Node 1.2: 'This is a nonzero monomial, hence finite and nonzero for all s (Node 1.2)' -- directly invoking the algebraic characterization.\n(3) Node 1.3: 'the nonzero torus value of W^circ (Node 1.3)' and 'The choice W = W^circ depends only on Pi (Node 1.3)' -- uses the test vector choice twice.\n(4) Node 1.4: The monomial form c(Pi,pi) q^{-k(Pi,pi) s} comes from the Iwasawa unfolding and torus collapse claimed in Node 1.4.\n(5) Node 1.5: 'the nonzero Gauss sum (Node 1.5)' -- directly using the Gauss sum nonvanishing.\n\nA QED node MUST depend on all its constituent nodes. Without declared dependencies:\n(a) The taint propagation system cannot track that Node 1.6 inherits all critical/major challenges from Nodes 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 (totaling 3 critical and 5 major challenges upstream).\n(b) The proof graph is structurally broken: a QED node with no dependencies is logically equivalent to an axiom, which a conclusion cannot be.\n(c) The inference type is listed as 'assumption' but should be a derivation (modus ponens or assembly), since Node 1.6 is not postulating a hypothesis -- it is combining established results.\n\nAll five dependencies (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5) must be declared, and the inference type must be changed from 'assumption' to an appropriate derivation type.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
