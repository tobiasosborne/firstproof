Node 1.4 (case (c)) constrains only the LAST torus coordinate: val(Q varpi^{m_n}) = -c(pi) forces m_n = 0 (since val(Q) = -c(pi)). But for n \u003e= 2, the torus element is a = diag(varpi^{m_1}, ..., varpi^{m_{n-1}}, 1), and the coordinates m_1, ..., m_{n-1} are UNCONSTRAINED by the conductor analysis. This was identified as a critical gap in Node 1.4 (challenge ch-b88f5d3a78be66d8). There is no single \"selected torus element\" -- there is an (n-1)-parameter family of torus elements.\n\nProblem 2 -- MATRINGE-MIYAUCHI SUPPORT CONDITIONS. The Matringe-Miyauchi explicit formula (Matringe 2013, Miyauchi 2014) gives the support of W^circ on the torus of GL_{n+1}(F). For GL_{n+1}, the new vector W^circ(diag(varpi^{m_1}, ..., varpi^{m_{n+1}})) is nonzero only when specific combinatorial conditions on the m_i hold (depending on the segments/exponents of Pi). It is NOT nonzero at every torus element. For the claim to work, we need:\n\n(a) Identify ALL torus elements a = diag(varpi^{m_1}, ..., varpi^{m_{n-1}}, 1) that contribute to the sum from Node 1.4 (those where both the K-integral and V^circ are nonzero).\n\n(b) Show that W^circ(diag(a,1)) = W^circ(diag(varpi^{m_1}, ..., varpi^{m_{n-1}}, 1, 1)) is nonzero for AT LEAST ONE such torus element.\n\n(c) Since multiple torus elements may contribute (the sum does not collapse for n \u003e= 2, per the critical challenge on Node 1.4), show that the SUM over all contributing torus elements is nonzero -- nonvanishing of individual terms does not suffice.\n\nThe node performs none of steps (a), (b), or (c). The blanket assertion \"nonzero by Matringe-Miyauchi\" without specifying which torus element is being evaluated is insufficient.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
