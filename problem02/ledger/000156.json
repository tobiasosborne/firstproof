The statement correctly captures the conjecture from problem.md with proper quantifier structure (EXISTS W FOR ALL pi EXISTS V). The decomposition into children 1.1-1.6 is logically complete, covering all cases: unramified pi (1.3.1, 1.3.2), ramified supercuspidal pi (1.4.4.1, 1.5.1), and ramified non-supercuspidal pi (1.4.4.2, 1.5.2). The proof strategy of fixing W = W^circ (essential Whittaker function of Pi) is consistent with the quantifier structure. One minor challenge raised (ch-fa48e6d443d): the conductor of psi should be specified as o to match problem.md. The root node's correctness as a statement/decomposition node is confirmed; the correctness of the full proof depends on all descendant nodes being validated, and there remain 26+ open challenges on descendants including multiple critical ones."}
