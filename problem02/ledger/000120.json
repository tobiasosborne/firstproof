The \"proof\" consists of:\n\n(i) V^circ(I_n) \\!= 0 implies Phi(1) \\!= 0.\n(ii) psi^{-1}(Q*-) has conductor q.\n(iii) V^circ has \"maximal Fourier content at the conductor level.\"\n(iv) \"Its Fourier coefficient at the conductor level is the Atkin-Lehner eigenvalue (or its higher-rank analogue), which is nonzero.\"\n(v) \"For GL_n with n \u003e= 2, this is a consequence of the fact that the Whittaker functional does not vanish on V^circ and the additive twist at the conductor level extracts a nonzero Fourier coefficient.\"\n\nNONE of these constitute a proof. Each is analyzed below:\n\n--- PROBLEM (A): Phi(1) \\!= 0 DOES NOT IMPLY THE WEIGHTED SUM IS NONZERO ---\n\nThe sum S = sum_{x} psi^{-1}(Qx) Phi(x) is a Fourier coefficient of the function Phi on the additive group o/q. Even if Phi(1) \\!= 0, the weighted sum S can vanish by cancellation. Concrete scenario: suppose Phi is approximately constant on (o/q)^x with value ~C. Then S ~ C * sum_{x in (o/q)^x} psi^{-1}(Qx) = C * (sum_{x in o/q} psi^{-1}(Qx) - Phi(0)/C * psi^{-1}(0)) = C * (0 - Phi(0)/C) = -Phi(0), using character orthogonality for the full sum. So S = -Phi(0) in this scenario, and nonvanishing depends on the NON-UNIT fiber contribution, which the node explicitly excluded from the analysis (see companion challenge on Step 2).\n\nMore precisely: for the sum over ALL of o/q (the correct domain, per the companion challenge), S = sum_{x in o/q} psi^{-1}(Qx) Phi(x) is the Fourier coefficient of Phi at frequency Q. This is nonzero if and only if Phi is not orthogonal to the character psi^{-1}(Q*-) in L^2(o/q). The fact that Phi(1) \\!= 0 says nothing about this orthogonality.\n\n--- PROBLEM (B): \"MAXIMAL FOURIER CONTENT AT THE CONDUCTOR LEVEL\" IS UNDEFINED ---\n\nThis phrase has no standard mathematical meaning. The node does not define it, does not state it as a theorem, and provides no reference. A proof cannot rest on an undefined property.\n\nPossible interpretation 1: The Fourier transform of Phi has nonzero coefficient at every frequency of maximal conductor. But this is exactly the claim to be proved -- circular.\n\nPossible interpretation 2: Some property of the new vector related to its minimality at level q. The minimality says V^circ is NOT fixed by K_1(p^{c-1}), which means V^circ has nontrivial variation at the q-level. But \"nontrivial variation\" does not imply any SPECIFIC Fourier coefficient is nonzero -- it implies at least one is, but not necessarily the one at frequency Q.\n\n--- PROBLEM (C): \"ATKIN-LEHNER EIGENVALUE OR ITS HIGHER-RANK ANALOGUE\" IS UNDEFINED FOR n \u003e= 2 ---\n\nFor GL_2, the Atkin-Lehner involution w_c: f(g) -\u003e f(g * [[0, 1], [p^c, 0]]) acts on the space of K_1(p^c)-fixed vectors. The new vector is an eigenvector with eigenvalue epsilon (the pseudo-eigenvalue or root number). The nonvanishing of certain sums then follows from |epsilon| = 1.\n\nFor GL_n with n \u003e= 2:\n- The \"Atkin-Lehner involution\" does not have a standard direct analogue. There are Atkin-Lehner-type operators (studied by Matringe 2013, Miyauchi 2014), but they act on a multi-dimensional space of old forms, not as a single involution.\n- The \"eigenvalue\" is not a single scalar for n \u003e= 2; the relevant structure is the epsilon factor epsilon(s, pi, psi), which is a monomial in q^{-s}, not a single complex number.\n- The node does not specify WHICH \"higher-rank analogue\" it means, does not cite a theorem establishing the analogue, and does not prove the sum equals this quantity.\n\nClaiming a result holds \"by the higher-rank analogue\" without defining the analogue or proving the claimed equality is not a proof.\n\n--- PROBLEM (D): STATEMENT (v) IS CIRCULAR ---\n\n\"For GL_n with n \u003e= 2, this is a consequence of the fact that the Whittaker functional does not vanish on V^circ and the additive twist at the conductor level extracts a nonzero Fourier coefficient.\"\n\nUnpacking: \"the additive twist at the conductor level extracts a nonzero Fourier coefficient\" IS the statement sum_{x} psi^{-1}(Qx) Phi(x) \\!= 0. So the \"proof\" says: \"The sum is nonzero because the sum is nonzero.\" This is textbook circular reasoning.\n\n--- PROBLEM (E): CONTRADICTION WITH PARENT NODE 1.5 ---\n\nThe parent node 1.5 (amended version) explicitly states in its corrections: \"(4) Conductor matching is the GL_1 mechanism (Tate thesis); for n \u003e= 2, epsilon factor nonvanishing is unconditional.\" Yet Node 1.5.1 attempts to use a conductor-matching-style argument: \"the additive character psi^{-1}(Q*-) has conductor exactly q = p^{c(pi)}, which matches the level at which V^circ is defined.\" If conductor matching is NOT the mechanism for n \u003e= 2 (as the parent node says), then why is Node 1.5.1 using it as the basis for its nonvanishing claim?\n\nThe correct approach for n \u003e= 2 would be one of:\n(a) Identify J_K(0) with (a value of) the epsilon factor epsilon(s, pi, psi) up to a nonzero constant, then invoke epsilon factor nonvanishing. This requires a nontrivial IDENTIFICATION theorem (e.g., test vector computations of Matringe or Assing-Blomer-Li), which the node does not provide.\n(b) Directly compute J_K(0) using the representation theory of GL_n(o/q) and the structure of V^circ as a Whittaker function for a cuspidal representation of GL_n(F_q), then evaluate the resulting finite-group character sum. This is feasible but requires substantial work that the node omits entirely.\n(c) Reduce to a known integral formula in the literature (e.g., Jacquet integral, Shahidi local coefficient). Again, the identification step is missing.\n\nSUMMARY: The core claim of Node 1.5.1 -- that J_K(0,...,0) \\!= 0 -- has no proof for n \u003e= 2. The node provides a correct proof for GL_1 (the Gauss sum/Tate thesis argument), then asserts without proof that the result extends to GL_n. Since this nonvanishing is the SOLE purpose of the node (the parent node 1.5 delegates NV2 entirely to 1.5.1), the entire node fails to establish its claimed result.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
