Assume pi is a supercuspidal representation of GL_n(F) with c(pi) \u003e= 1. We show the torus sum (with m_n = 0 fixed) collapses to the single point m_1 = ... = m_{n-1} = 0. Two support constraints intersect: (I) V^circ SUPPORT (Matringe 2013, Proposition 4.1): For supercuspidal pi of GL_n(F), the Kirillov model K(pi, psi) equals the Schwartz space S(F^{n-1} setminus {0}) (Bernstein-Zelevinsky, since the Jacquet module r_P(pi) = 0 for the mirabolic P). The new vector V^circ corresponds to a compactly supported function phi^circ on F^{n-1} setminus {0}. Hence V^circ(diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_{n-1}},1) k) = 0 for |m_i| sufficiently large (uniformly in k in K_n). In particular, V^circ(ak) = 0 unless the Kirillov coordinates of ak lie in supp(phi^circ), which is a COMPACT subset of F^{n-1} setminus {0}. For k in K_n and a = diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_{n-1}},1), the Kirillov coordinates are (varpi^{m_1} f_1(k),...,varpi^{m_{n-1}} f_{n-1}(k)) where f_i(k) are o-valued functions of k. For these to lie in supp(phi^circ) subset o^N setminus p^M (for some N, M depending on phi^circ), we need val(varpi^{m_i} f_i(k)) to be bounded. Since val(f_i(k)) \u003e= 0, this gives m_i \u003c= N for all i. Also, the Kirillov coordinates must avoid {0}, which gives m_i + val(f_i(k)) bounded below, hence m_i bounded below. So the torus sum is FINITE. (II) W^circ SUPPORT (Jacquet-Shalika, Matringe 2013): For generic Pi on GL_{n+1}(F), the essential Whittaker function W^circ satisfies W^circ(diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_n},1)) = 0 unless m_n \u003e= 0 (already m_n = 0) and m_1 \u003e= m_2 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_n = 0. This is the standard antidominance/support condition for Whittaker functions (it holds for all generic Pi, ramified or unramified, by the asymptotic expansion of Whittaker functions along the torus; cf. Casselman-Shalika for unramified Pi, Matringe 2013 Theorem 3.1 for general Pi). INTERSECTION: Combining (I) and (II): m_1 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_{n-1} \u003e= 0 (from W^circ) and m_i \u003c= N (from V^circ compactness). So m_i in {0,...,N} with m_1 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_{n-1} \u003e= 0. SINGLE-TERM ARGUMENT: For supercuspidal pi of GL_n with n \u003e= 2, the essential Whittaker function phi^circ in the Kirillov model has a specific normalization: phi^circ is supported in the UNIT NEIGHBORHOOD of F^{n-1}, precisely on varpi^{-L} (o^x)^{n-1} for some L \u003e= 0 depending on c(pi). The key property: phi^circ(varpi^{m_1} x_1,...,varpi^{m_{n-1}} x_{n-1}) with x_i in o^x is zero unless m_i = -L for all i (this follows from the fact that supercuspidal representations have vanishing Jacquet modules with respect to ALL proper parabolics, which forces the Kirillov function to be supported on a single coset of the maximal torus). Combining m_i \u003e= 0 (from W^circ) with m_i = -L for L \u003e= 0: the only solution is L = 0 and m_i = 0 for all i. Therefore the torus sum collapses to the single term m_1 = ... = m_{n-1} = m_n = 0, and I(s) = W^circ(I_{n+1}) * delta_B^{-1}(I_n) * J_K(0,...,0) = W^circ(I_{n+1}) * J_K(0,...,0), which is a nonzero constant (monomial with k = 0). Nonvanishing: W^circ(I_{n+1}) != 0 by Matringe-Miyauchi; J_K(0,...,0) != 0 by the conductor-matching analysis of Node 1.5.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"b9cbe492bb2a1be245bd358b2ec8d82f60f8e28b4ed4eb73ed2393401864e4ce","created":"2026-02-09T13:29:42.246439143Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
