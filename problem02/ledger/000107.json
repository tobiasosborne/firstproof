Therefore J_K(m) = 0 for 1 \u003c= m_n \u003c= c-1.'\n\nThe vanishing of the K_1(p^{c-m_n})-average of V^circ is correct: since c-m_n \u003c c = c(pi), the space pi^{K_1(p^{c-m_n})} = {0} by minimality of the conductor, so the projection of any vector (including V^circ) onto this space is zero.\n\nHowever, the node does NOT explain how this implies the Fourier coefficient vanishes. The Fourier coefficient is:\n\n  sum_{x in o/q} chi^{-1}(x) Phi(a,x)\n\nwhere chi(x) = psi(Q varpi^{m_n} x) and Phi(a,x) = sum_{k-bar in F_x} V^circ(a lift(k-bar)). This is a Fourier coefficient of the function Phi(a,-) on the additive group o/q. The K_1(p^{c-m_n})-average of V^circ is an integral of V^circ over a MULTIPLICATIVE subgroup K_1(p^{c-m_n}). These are different operations on different groups.\n\nThe MISSING connecting step is:\n\n(1) For h in K_1(p^{c-m_n})/K_1(p^c), the right-translation k-bar -\u003e k-bar h sends (k-bar)_{nn} to (k-bar h)_{nn} = (k-bar)_{nn} + delta where delta in p^{c-m_n}/p^c (by the same computation as in the K_1(q)-invariance check).\n\n(2) The character chi is trivial on p^{c-m_n} (since val(Q varpi^{m_n} p^{c-m_n}) = (m_n - c) + (c - m_n) = 0, so the product is in o = ker psi). Hence chi(k-bar_{nn}) = chi((k-bar h)_{nn}), i.e., the character is K_1(p^{c-m_n})-invariant in the k_{nn} variable.\n\n(3) Therefore, right-translating by h preserves chi^{-1}(k-bar_{nn}) but sends V^circ(a lift(k-bar)) to V^circ(a lift(k-bar) lift(h)) = V^circ(a lift(k-bar) h'). Averaging the entire sum over H = K_1(p^{c-m_n})/K_1(p^c), the character factor is unchanged while V^circ gets K_1(p^{c-m_n})-averaged, yielding zero.\n\nThis three-step argument is the actual proof. Without it, the node's claim is a non sequitur: 'the K_1-average vanishes, therefore the Fourier coefficient vanishes' is not a valid inference without showing why the two quantities are related. The word 'generically' in the node text ('generically vanishes') is also incorrect — the vanishing is for ALL a in the torus, not just generically.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
