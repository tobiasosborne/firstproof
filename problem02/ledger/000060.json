The K-integral J_K(m) = int_{K_n} psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} k_{nn}) V^circ(ak) dk factors through K_n/K_1(q) = GL_n(o/q), since both the twist and V^circ are right K_1(q)-invariant. Decompose GL_n(o/q) by the n,n-entry: for each x in o/q, let F_x be the fiber of matrices in GL_n(o/q) with bottom-right entry x. Then J_K(m) is proportional to sum_{x in o/q} psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} x) Phi(a, x), where Phi(a, x) = sum_{k in F_x} V^circ(a times lift(k)). This is a FINITE FOURIER TRANSFORM in x over o/q. The additive character x -\u003e psi(Q varpi^{m_n} x) on o/q has level c - m_n within o/q (trivial on p^{c-m_n}/p^c). For the Fourier coefficient to be nonzero, Phi(a, -) must have nontrivial Fourier content at this level. Case (b): when m_n \u003c 0, the character psi(Q varpi^{m_n} -) restricted to o has conductor p^{c-m_n} strictly containing o (since c - m_n \u003e c), so it oscillates at a level finer than any function on o/q. The integral vanishes by additive character orthogonality. For 1 \u003c= m_n \u003c= c-1: the additive level c - m_n is strictly between 0 and c; the Fourier coefficient at this intermediate level generically vanishes because V^circ is the new vector at level c (not at any lower level). Specifically, the new vector V^circ is characterized as the unique K_1(q)-fixed vector up to scalars, and it is NOT fixed by any larger group K_1(p^{c-1}). The K_1(p^{c-m_n})-average of V^circ vanishes for 0 \u003c c - m_n \u003c c by the minimality of the conductor. Therefore J_K(m) = 0 for 1 \u003c= m_n \u003c= c-1. Combined with case (a) and case (b), J_K(m) = 0 unless m_n = 0.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"75ca171965acefe9fd0573f2a16d20cee2a6e32d58037150f61505ee76e932d7","created":"2026-02-09T13:23:37.853939838Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
