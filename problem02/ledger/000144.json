The next sentence then says: 'For m_n \u003c 0, we use that V^circ(ak) = 0 when the torus element a is sufficiently far from the support of V^circ.'\n\nTWO PROBLEMS:\n\n(1) THE FACTORIZATION CLAIM IS OVERSTATED. The node says 'the integrand factors through K_n/K_1(q) = GL_n(o/q)' without restricting to m_n \u003e= 0. For m_n \u003c 0, the twist is NOT K_1(q)-invariant (val(Q varpi^{m_n} p^c) = m_n \u003c 0, so psi is nontrivial on the error term), so the integrand does NOT factor through GL_n(o/q). The statement should explicitly restrict this factorization to m_n \u003e= 0.\n\n(2) THE FALLBACK FOR m_n \u003c 0 IS VAGUE AND MATHEMATICALLY INCOMPLETE. 'V^circ(ak) = 0 when the torus element a is sufficiently far from the support of V^circ' does not handle ALL m_n \u003c 0. For m_n = -1 with the other m_i in the support of V^circ, the torus element a = diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_{n-1}}, varpi^{-1}) may well be in the support of V^circ. The correct argument for vanishing at m_n \u003c 0 is the K_1(q)-averaging argument: write J_K(m) = sum_{k-bar in GL_n(o/q)} V^circ(a*lift(k-bar)) * int_{K_1(q)} psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} (k-bar*h)_{nn}) dh. Since (k-bar*h)_{nn} = (k-bar)_{nn} + epsilon with epsilon in p^c, the inner integral equals psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} (k-bar)_{nn}) * int_{p^c} psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} * epsilon) d(epsilon). The character psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} *) is nontrivial on p^c when m_n \u003c 0, so the inner integral vanishes by character orthogonality on the compact group p^c. Therefore J_K(m) = 0 for all m_n \u003c 0, uniformly, regardless of V^circ support. This clean argument should replace the vague support hand-wave.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
