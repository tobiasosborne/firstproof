Precisely: the poles of L(s, Pi x pi) arise from the contribution of spherical vectors; the twist by psi^{-1}(Q g_{nn}) with val(Q) = -c(pi) \u003c 0 introduces oscillation that kills the residue at each pole. This can be verified case-by-case for the Langlands classification of pi using multiplicativity of gamma factors (Shahidi 1984) or by direct computation.'\n\nTHREE PROBLEMS:\n\n(1) 'OSCILLATION KILLS THE RESIDUE' IS NOT A PROOF. The phrases 'prevents the integral from achieving the maximal growth' and 'introduces oscillation that kills the residue' are metaphorical descriptions, not mathematical arguments. The claim is that the Laurent polynomial P(q^{-s}) in I(s) = P(q^{-s}) * L(s, Pi x pi) cancels every pole of L(s, Pi x pi). This is a specific algebraic statement about the divisibility of P by the denominator factors (1 - alpha_j q^{-s}) of L. Metaphors about oscillation do not constitute a proof of polynomial divisibility.\n\n(2) THE CASE-BY-CASE VERIFICATION IS NOT CARRIED OUT. The node says 'This can be verified case-by-case for the Langlands classification of pi using multiplicativity of gamma factors (Shahidi 1984) or by direct computation.' No case is verified. The Langlands classification has infinitely many types (indexed by partitions and supercuspidal data), and 'direct computation' for even the simplest non-trivial case (GL_3 x GL_2 with pi a ramified principal series) is not provided. Claiming something 'can be verified' without verifying it is not a proof.\n\n(3) THE CHILDREN USE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ARGUMENT. The children establish absence of poles via finiteness of the torus sum:\n- 1.4.4.1 (supercuspidal): torus sum is a single term =\u003e I(s) is a constant =\u003e no poles.\n- 1.4.4.2 (non-supercuspidal): torus sum is finite =\u003e I(s) is a finite Laurent polynomial =\u003e no poles (trivially: a polynomial has no poles).\n\nThe parent node's oscillation argument is therefore REDUNDANT. The correct argument at the parent level should be: 'By the children's analyses (1.4.4.1 and 1.4.4.2), the torus sum is finite in all cases. Therefore I(s) is a finite Laurent polynomial in q^{-s}, which automatically has no poles (no denominators). The factorization I(s) = P(q^{-s}) * L(s, Pi x pi) from JPSS is consistent: P must cancel all poles of L, which it does because I(s) = P * L is a polynomial.'\n\nThe node should replace the non-rigorous oscillation argument with this trivial observation, which correctly reduces the pole-freeness question to finiteness of the torus sum (delegated to children).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
