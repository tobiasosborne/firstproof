Node 1.5.1's title is 'K-integral Nonvanishing at the Identity (Supercuspidal Case).' Its statement begins: 'Let pi be a supercuspidal representation of GL_n(F).' Every step of Node 1.5.1's argument uses properties specific to the supercuspidal case:\n   - Step 1 uses that V^circ is right-K_1(q)-invariant with q = p^{c(pi)}, valid for all pi, but the finite-sum reduction relies on GL_n(o/q) having a specific structure relative to V^circ.\n   - Step 2 decomposes by k_{nn}-fibers.\n   - Step 3 claims the Fourier sum is nonzero — but the Fourier analysis of V^circ on GL_n(o/q) depends crucially on the representation type. For supercuspidal pi, V^circ restricted to GL_n(o/q) yields a cuspidal representation of the finite group GL_n(F_q). For non-supercuspidal pi (e.g., a principal series), V^circ restricted to GL_n(o/q) yields a NON-cuspidal representation with fundamentally different Fourier-analytic properties.\n\nThe phrase 'by Node 1.5.1 logic' is hand-waving that conceals a case distinction that the proof has not carried out.\n\n(2) NODE 1.5.1 ITSELF HAS THREE OPEN CHALLENGES (ch-e9fa9101d77883bc, ch-3463f8fdc17b78ab, ch-eb07d1ae912b4c61). In particular, ch-3463f8fdc17b78ab is a critical challenge showing that the Fourier nonvanishing claim in Step 3 of Node 1.5.1 is CIRCULAR even for the supercuspidal case. The node asserts: 'the additive twist at the conductor level extracts a nonzero Fourier coefficient' but this is precisely the claim being proved. So even for supercuspidal pi, the J_K(0) \\!= 0 result is not established. Invoking 'Node 1.5.1 logic' invokes a broken argument.\n\n(3) EVEN IF J_K(0) \\!= 0 HELD, THE SUM HAS MULTIPLE TERMS. For non-supercuspidal ramified pi, the torus sum has multiple contributing m-tuples (this is the whole point of Node 1.4.4.2 — the sum is finite but NOT a single term). So I(1/2) = sum_m c_m, where c_m = W^circ(diag(a_m, 1)) * J_K(m, 0) * delta^{-1} * |det|^0. Even if c_0 \\!= 0, the sum could vanish by cancellation among terms. The node says 'the remaining terms are controlled by the Matringe support formula' but 'controlled' is not a mathematical statement. It could mean: the other terms are zero (not true in general for non-supercuspidal pi), the other terms are small (irrelevant — the sum is finite and exact, not approximate), or the other terms have known signs (not established). Without a precise statement and proof that the sum does not cancel, the nonvanishing of I(1/2) is not established.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
