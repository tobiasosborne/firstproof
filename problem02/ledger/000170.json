The node writes the RS integral for n=1 as: \"sum_{m in Z} W^circ(diag(varpi^m, 1)) psi^{-1}(Q varpi^m) phi_0(varpi^m) |varpi^m|^{s-1/2} delta_B^{-1}(varpi^m).\" For GL_2 x GL_1, the integral is over N_1\\GL_1(F) = F^x, with measure d^x a. There is no Iwasawa decomposition needed for GL_1 (it has no compact subgroup K that requires unfolding in the GL_2 x GL_1 setting). The factor delta_B^{-1}(varpi^m) is the modular character of the Borel of GL_1, which is trivial (GL_1 has no proper Borel subgroup; the Borel of GL_1 is GL_1 itself, with trivial modular character). So delta_B^{-1}(varpi^m) = 1. While this does not change the final answer (the factor is 1), including it suggests confusion about the GL_1 Iwasawa decomposition and could indicate a cut-and-paste from the general GL_n formula without adapting to the n=1 case.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
