Proof: the map s -\u003e q^{-s} surjects onto C*, and the only rational functions with no zeros or poles on C* are monomials. Combined with JPSS theory (the Rankin-Selberg integral extends to a rational function in q^{-s}), our goal reduces to showing the integral equals a nonzero monomial.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"05c59aad1c646c7e3ed4b45dd8baf4679320b9d6f2eb68fa3b88612e42da38db","created":"2026-02-09T11:55:04.170921844Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
