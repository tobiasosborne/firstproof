Without Node 1.4, the object tau(pi, psi_Q) has no definition in the proof.\n\n(2) Node 1.3 (Choice of Test Vectors): The statement says \"The essential Whittaker function value W^circ(diag(a,1))...\" -- directly using the test vector choice W = W^circ from Node 1.3.\n\n(3) Node 1.4 again for \"the selected torus element\": The torus element at which W^circ is evaluated comes from the conductor analysis in Node 1.4 (case (c)).\n\nFurthermore, the inference type is listed as \"assumption\" but Node 1.5 is not postulating a hypothesis -- it claims to PROVE a nonvanishing result using prior results and external references. The inference type should be a derivation or citation, not an assumption.\n\nAll three missing dependencies must be declared. The fact that Node 1.4 has open critical challenges (ch-b88f5d3a78be66d8, ch-f40b2cf73eaa8ef3) means Node 1.5 inherits taint from Node 1.4 once the dependency is correctly declared.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
