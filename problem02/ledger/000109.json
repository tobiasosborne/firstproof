This is not an axiom or global hypothesis.\n\n(2) The node implicitly depends on:\n  - Node 1.4 (parent): for the definition of J_K(m) and the setup of the Iwasawa unfolding.\n  - Node 1.4.1: for the W^circ factorization (J_K(m) only involves V^circ, not W^circ, which requires the factorization from 1.4.1).\n  - Node 1.4.2: explicitly referenced via 'Combined with case (a)' — the conclusion 'J_K(m) = 0 unless m_n = 0' depends on 1.4.2 for the m_n \u003e c case.\n  - Node 1.3: for the properties of V^circ (K_1(q)-invariance, conductor minimality).\n\nNone of these dependencies are declared.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
