The node never states what k actually equals, nor how it depends on the conductor exponents of Pi and pi.\n\nTracing through the proof (assuming all upstream nodes hold):\n\nFor n = 1 (GL(2) x GL(1)): The conductor analysis in Node 1.4 case (c) forces val(Q varpi^{m_1}) = -c(pi). Since val(Q) = -c(pi), this gives m_1 = 0. The only torus element is a* = 1, so k = val(det a*) = 0. The integral is a constant (independent of s).\n\nFor n \u003e= 2: Node 1.4 case (c) forces val(Q varpi^{m_n}) = -c(pi), giving m_n = 0 (since val(Q) = -c(pi)). But m_1, ..., m_{n-1} are unconstrained (this is the critical challenge ch-b88f5d3a78be66d8 on Node 1.4). If the torus sum were to collapse to a single term (which it does not for n \u003e= 2, per that challenge), then k = m_1* + ... + m_{n-1}* + 0, but the values m_1*, ..., m_{n-1}* are never determined.\n\nEven in the most favorable interpretation (n = 1 where everything works), k = 0 should be stated explicitly. The claim that k 'depends on conductor exponents' is misleading for n = 1 since k = 0 is universal.\n\nFor the statement to be meaningful, the node must provide: (a) the formula for k in terms of the parameters of Pi and pi, (b) which 'conductor exponents' it depends on (c(Pi)? c(pi)? the Satake parameters?), and (c) a derivation showing how k arises from the Iwasawa decomposition. As written, 'an explicit integer depending on conductor exponents' is no more informative than 'some integer.'","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
