For ramified Pi (the general case in this proof), W^circ is the essential/new vector, which is NOT the spherical vector, and the Casselman-Shalika formula does NOT apply. The torus values of W^circ for ramified Pi follow the MATRINGE (2013) explicit formulas (Theorem 3.1), which express W^circ in terms of segment combinatorics of the Langlands data, NOT Schur polynomials. The Matringe formulas involve products over segments in the multisegment classification, with each factor depending on the supercuspidal support and the segment lengths. These are structurally different from Schur polynomials.\n\nThe phrase 'or their ramified analogues' is a hedge with no mathematical content. There is no standard mathematical object called a 'ramified analogue of Schur polynomials' in the representation theory of p-adic GL_n. The closest objects would be:\n(a) Demazure characters (type A key polynomials), which arise in the Iwahori-Hecke algebra context but are not analogues of Casselman-Shalika values.\n(b) Matringe's product formulas, which are explicit but bear no structural resemblance to Schur polynomials.\n(c) The more general Miyauchi (2014) formulas for conductor exponents, which give torus support conditions but not values.\n\nThe node's argument uses the (claimed) relationship to Schur polynomials to argue that 'the sign structure of W^circ' prevents cancellation. Even for the unramified case where Casselman-Shalika applies, Schur polynomials CAN take both positive and negative values on the torus (the signs depend on lambda and the Satake parameters), so 'sign structure prevents cancellation' is not an automatic consequence of the Schur polynomial formula. For the ramified case, the Matringe values need not have any definite sign pattern at all.\n\nThe invocation of Schur polynomials (or their nonexistent ramified analogues) as the mechanism preventing cancellation is both factually incorrect for ramified Pi and logically insufficient even for unramified Pi.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
