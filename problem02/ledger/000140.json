The support is on a CONE, not a single affine line. Specifically, W^circ_{St_k}(diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_k})) is nonzero when m_1 \u003e= m_2 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_k and the differences m_l - m_{l+1} satisfy certain constraints from the segment structure. The claim that the support is a single arithmetic progression is too restrictive.\n\n(2) FOR GENERALIZED STEINBERG Delta_i = St_{k_i}(rho_i) with rho_i supercuspidal on GL_{d_i} (where d_i \u003e= 2), the block structure is more complex. Each segment entry is rho_i * nu^j, which is a representation of GL_{d_i}, not GL_1. The torus support within the GL_{n_i}-torus (where n_i = k_i * d_i) involves the torus support of rho_i itself within each GL_{d_i}-block, combined with the segment shifts between blocks. The formula m_{j_l} = m_{j_1} + l - 1 does not account for the internal torus structure of the supercuspidal rho_i on GL_{d_i}.\n\n(3) The phrase 'modulo the supercuspidal support of rho_i' is doing heavy lifting without mathematical content. The supercuspidal support of rho_i constrains the Whittaker values WITHIN each GL_{d_i}-block of the Levi, but these constraints interact nontrivially with the Steinberg pattern BETWEEN blocks. The node should spell out the actual support conditions from Matringe's work rather than waving them away.\n\nThe claimed support formula is at best a rough heuristic, not a precise mathematical statement. The finiteness of the torus sum may still follow by other arguments, but the stated support formula needs correction.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
