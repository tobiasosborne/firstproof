This follows from conjugating u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1} past diag(g,1): the element n'(g,Q) = I_{n+1} + Q sum_i g_{in} E_{i,n+1} lies in N_{n+1}, and the generic character psi^{-1} evaluates on n'(g,Q) to psi^{-1}(Q g_{nn}) since only the (n,n+1) superdiagonal entry contributes. The factor psi^{-1}(Q g_{nn}) is left-N_n-invariant, so the integrand remains well-defined on N_n \\ GL_n(F).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"7e084f6659f32450878c01f478d60aa0b72395495fc0a0c01e0f88ec5c6528c4","created":"2026-02-09T11:55:04.170914124Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
