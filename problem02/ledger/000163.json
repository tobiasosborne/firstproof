This IS the statement being proved — circular reasoning.\n\n(2) The appeal to the 'Atkin-Lehner eigenvalue or its higher-rank analogue' is undefined for n \u003e= 2. For GL_2, the Atkin-Lehner theory gives a clean eigenvalue relating the twisted sum to the root number. For GL_n with n \u003e= 2, there is no single Atkin-Lehner involution acting on the new vector space; the relevant operators are studied by Matringe (2013) and Miyauchi (2014), but the node does not cite or use their specific results.\n\n(3) The claim that Phi(1) != 0 (which is correct, from V^circ(I_n) != 0) does NOT imply S != 0. The weighted sum can vanish by cancellation even when individual terms are nonzero.\n\n(4) Challenge ch-e9fa9101d77883bc [major, open] additionally shows that the restriction of the sum to (o/q)^x (excluding non-units) in Step 2 is unjustified for n \u003e= 2.\n\nSince J_K(0,...,0) != 0 is the SOLE mechanism for nonvanishing in Case 2, and this claim is unproved at the upstream node, Case 2 of Node 1.6 is not established. The QED node cannot assert this result without the upstream verification being complete.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
