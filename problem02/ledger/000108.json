NOT m_n = c.\n  - This node handles 1 \u003c= m_n \u003c= c-1. NOT m_n = c.\n  - The conclusion 'J_K(m) = 0 unless m_n = 0' implicitly claims J_K vanishes at m_n = c, but no argument is given.\n\nFor m_n = c: the character psi(Q varpi^c x) on o has val(Q varpi^c) = -c + c = 0, so Q varpi^c is a unit in o. Then psi(Q varpi^c x) is trivial for x in o (since Q varpi^c x in o = ker psi). The twist disappears and J_K = int_{K_n} V^circ(ak) dk = 0 by the K-projection argument (pi^{K_n} = 0 for c(pi) \u003e= 1). This is the same argument as 1.4.2, but 1.4.2 requires m_n \u003e c STRICTLY.\n\nThe fix is straightforward (either 1.4.2 should handle m_n \u003e= c, or 1.4.3 should include m_n = c as a separate case), but as written the case analysis has a gap at m_n = c.\n\nAdditionally, the node's role is confused: it claims scope '0 \u003c= m_n \u003c= c(pi)' from the parent's case (c), but then takes responsibility for case (b) (m_n \u003c 0) from the parent, which is a different case entirely. The node should either (i) restrict to its stated scope and leave case (b) to the parent, or (ii) expand its stated scope to cover all m_n and handle everything. The current hybrid approach is incoherent.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
