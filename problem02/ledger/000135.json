Step (C) explicitly states: 'This step requires careful verification and is the subject of ongoing work. The identity is expected to hold based on the analogy with the GL_2 case where it is verified explicitly.'\n\nThis is a fatal gap. The phrases 'subject of ongoing work' and 'expected to hold based on the analogy' are admissions that the identity has NOT been established. An 'expected' identity based on 'analogy' is not a proof -- it is a conjecture.\n\nThe specific identity claimed would require showing that the right-translation R(u_Q) on W^circ introduces exactly the epsilon factor in the Rankin-Selberg integral. For GL_2, this is classical Atkin-Lehner theory. For GL_{n+1} x GL_n with n \u003e= 2, this is substantially deeper and NOT established in the generality needed:\n\n(1) u_Q is unipotent, not an Atkin-Lehner involution. R(u_Q) introduces an additive twist, but identifying this with epsilon requires explicit test vector computations.\n(2) Humphries (2021) primarily concerns GL_2. Assing-Blomer (2024) works in specific analytic settings, not full generality.\n(3) The relevant general theory (Humphries-Jo 2021+) is not even cited.\n\nSince step (C) is the ONLY mechanism in the primary argument for reducing a finite Laurent polynomial to a monomial, and step (C) is self-admittedly unproven, the primary monomial property argument is fatally incomplete.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
