Challenge ch-21a16ed7981 (MISSING DEPENDENCY DECLARATIONS ON NODES 1.3 AND 1.4) was marked 'resolved' but the formal metadata of Node 1.5 shows 'Dependencies: (none)'. The node text was amended to mention 'DEPENDENCIES: Node 1.3, Node 1.4' in the statement body, but the actual af dependency metadata field was never updated. Moreover, the textual dependency list is INCOMPLETE. The node explicitly invokes results from: (1) Node 1.2: 'completing the monomial argument from Node 1.2.' (2) Node 1.3: 'test vectors chosen in Node 1.3.' (3) Node 1.4: Iwasawa unfolding. (4) Node 1.4.1: K-integral definition. (5) Nodes 1.4.2 and 1.4.3: K-integral vanishing. (6) Node 1.4.4.1: supercuspidal torus collapse. (7) Node 1.4.4.2: non-supercuspidal finite sum. The formal dependency metadata should list: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3, 1.4.4.1, 1.4.4.2. Taint cannot propagate correctly without formal declarations. Critically: Node 1.4.4 has 4 open challenges (1 critical), Node 1.4.4.2 has 1 open critical challenge, and Node 1.4.3 has 4 open challenges (1 critical). This taint should propagate to 1.5 but does not.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
