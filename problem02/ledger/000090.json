The node states: 'the Casselman-Shalika formula gives W^circ(diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_n},1)) = 0 unless m_1 \u003e= m_2 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_n \u003e= 0'. This is the Casselman-Shalika formula for the SPHERICAL (K_{n+1}-fixed) Whittaker function of GL_{n+1}(F). It applies ONLY when Pi is an unramified representation.\n\nHowever, the problem statement requires the construction to work for ALL generic irreducible admissible representations Pi of GL_{n+1}(F), including ramified Pi. Node 1.3 sets W = W^circ universally (the essential Whittaker function / new vector of Pi). For ramified Pi (c(Pi) \u003e= 1), W^circ is NOT the spherical Whittaker function; it is the K_1(p^{c(Pi)})-fixed new vector. The Casselman-Shalika formula does not describe the torus support of this vector.\n\nFor ramified Pi, the torus support of W^circ can differ substantially from the dominance cone {m_1 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_{n+1} \u003e= 0}. For instance, for supercuspidal Pi, the new vector W^circ has COMPACT support modulo center, so the issue is different. But for ramified principal series or other non-supercuspidal ramified representations, W^circ can be nonzero at torus elements outside the dominant cone, including at elements with some m_i \u003c 0.\n\nSince the torus collapse argument in (P1) requires BOTH directions (m_i \u003c= 0 from V_0 AND m_i \u003e= 0 from W^circ via Casselman-Shalika), the failure of the Casselman-Shalika support condition for ramified Pi means the collapse to m_i = 0 is not established for ramified Pi. The argument needs either: (a) a replacement for the Casselman-Shalika support condition that works for all Pi, or (b) a case-by-case analysis of the W^circ support for ramified Pi showing the collapse still occurs.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
