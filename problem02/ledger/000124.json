Humphries' 'The Newform K-Type and p-adic Spherical Harmonics' (Trans. AMS 373, 2021) establishes test vector results for GL_2 local newforms. Theorem 1.1 concerns GL_2 x GL_1 Rankin-Selberg integrals, where the Atkin-Lehner theory provides a clean relationship between twisted newforms and epsilon factors. The extension to GL_{n+1} x GL_n for n \u003e= 2 is a substantially harder problem that this paper does not address. The node cites this paper as if it covers the general case.\n\n(B) ASSING-BLOMER (2024) DOES NOT ESTABLISH THE GENERAL IDENTITY. Assing-Blomer work on density conjectures and subconvexity bounds, using test vector results in specific analytic contexts. Their Theorem 1.3 provides test vector computations in the setting they need, but does not establish the universal identity Psi(s, R(u_Q)W^circ, V^circ) = C * epsilon(s, Pi x pi, psi) for ALL generic Pi on GL_{n+1} and ALL non-supercuspidal ramified pi on GL_n. Their results often carry hypotheses on the specific types of representations involved.\n\n(C) NODE 1.4.4.2 ITSELF ACKNOWLEDGES THE GAP. The dependency node 1.4.4.2 explicitly states about the analogous identity: 'This step requires careful verification and is the subject of ongoing work. The identity is expected to hold based on the analogy with the GL_2 case where it is verified explicitly, and the general theory of test vectors for epsilon factors (cf. Humphries 2021, Assing-Blomer 2024).' The phrase 'the subject of ongoing work' directly contradicts Node 1.5.2 treating this as an established result.\n\n(D) THE TWIST R(u_Q) IS NOT THE ATKIN-LEHNER INVOLUTION. For GL_2, the Atkin-Lehner involution w_{c} acts on newforms and the relationship between w_c-twisted newforms and epsilon factors is classical. For GL_{n+1} with n \u003e= 2, the element u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1} is a UNIPOTENT element, not an Atkin-Lehner-type element. The right-translation R(u_Q) introduces an additive character twist (by Node 1.1), which is algebraically different from the Atkin-Lehner action. The identification of the R(u_Q)-twisted integral with the epsilon factor would require showing that this specific twist, among all possible twists of W^circ, is the one that produces the epsilon factor. This is a non-trivial statement requiring proof.\n\n(E) WHAT IS ACTUALLY KNOWN FOR GL_{n+1} x GL_n: The standard JPSS theory gives Psi(s, W^circ, V^circ) = L(s, Pi x pi) (when both are newforms, without twist). The epsilon factor appears in the FUNCTIONAL EQUATION as the ratio gamma(s) = epsilon(s) * L(1-s)/L(s). To extract epsilon from a SPECIFIC integral evaluation (rather than as a quotient in the functional equation), one needs explicit test vector computations. For GL_{n+1} x GL_n with n \u003e= 2, the relevant test vector theory is developed in works by Jacquet-Shalika, Matringe (2013), and more recently by Jo (2021) and Humphries-Jo (2021), but the complete story for arbitrary generic representations is not settled. The node does not cite Humphries-Jo or Jo, who are the primary authors working on this problem in the generality needed.\n\nCONCLUSION: Step 3, which is one of the two proof paths offered by the node, rests on an identity that is NOT established in the cited literature for the generality claimed (all generic Pi on GL_{n+1}, all non-supercuspidal ramified pi on GL_n, arbitrary n \u003e= 2). The correct citations would need to include Humphries-Jo (2021+) and even then the coverage of all cases would need to be verified. As currently written, this step is an unsupported assertion dressed up as a citation.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
