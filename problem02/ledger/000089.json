The argument for (P1) and (P3) rests on the claim that V_0(ak) = phi_0(varpi^{m_1} k_{1n}, ..., varpi^{m_{n-1}} k_{n-1,n}), i.e., that the Whittaker function V_0 evaluated at ak equals the Kirillov model function phi_0 evaluated at certain matrix entries of ak. This is FALSE for n \u003e= 2.\n\nThe Kirillov model K(pi, psi) realizes pi|_{P_n} on functions on F^{n-1} \\ {0}, where P_n = {g in GL_n : last row is (0,...,0,1)} is the mirabolic subgroup. It directly describes V_0(p) for p in P_n. However, for general k in K_n = GL_n(o), the element ak is NOT in P_n (since the last row of ak is (varpi^{m_n} k_{n1}, ..., varpi^{m_n} k_{nn}), which is not (0,...,0,1) unless m_n=0 and k has special form). When k not in P_n, evaluating V_0(ak) requires the FULL representation action pi(k) on the Kirillov model, not pointwise evaluation of phi_0.\n\nConcretely for GL_2 (n=2): V_0 corresponds to phi_0 = char(o^x). For k = w = (0,1;-1,0) in GL_2(o), this k is NOT in P_2 = {(a b; 0 1)}. The representation action pi(w) on the Kirillov model involves an intertwining operator (a p-adic Fourier-like transform), NOT pointwise evaluation. So V_0(w) = (pi(w)phi_0)(1), which depends on pi non-trivially and is generally not equal to phi_0(w_{12}) = phi_0(1) = 1.\n\nSince a positive-measure subset of K_n lies outside P_n (via the Bruhat decomposition), the claimed support constraint V_0(ak) = 0 unless all varpi^{m_i} k_{in} are in o^x does not follow from phi_0 = char((o^x)^{n-1}) without proving how the K-action interacts with the Kirillov support. No such argument is provided.\n\nThis invalidates BOTH (P1) (the constraint m_i \u003c= 0 depends on this identification) AND (P3) (the K-integral computation int_{K_n} V_0(k) dk = vol({k : k_{in} in o^x}) uses the same false identification).\n\nDEEPER CONCERN: If we instead compute the K-average correctly, int_{K_n} V_0(ak) dk = Proj_K(V_0)(a), which is the K-projection of V_0 evaluated at a. For unramified pi, the K-fixed subspace is 1-dimensional spanned by V^circ (the spherical Whittaker function). If the projection is nonzero, then int_K V_0(ak) dk = c * V^circ(a) for some constant c != 0, and the integral I(s) would reduce to c times the standard Rankin-Selberg L-function L(s, Pi x pi), which has poles and is NOT a monomial. This would refute the entire strategy of Node 1.3 for unramified pi.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
