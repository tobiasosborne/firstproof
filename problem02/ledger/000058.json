For any c \u003e= 0, the K_1(p^c) subgroup of GL_{n+1}(o) consists of matrices g in GL_{n+1}(o) with g_{n+1,j} = delta_{n+1,j} mod p^c for all j. Since (diag(k,1))_{n+1,j} = delta_{n+1,j} for all j (exactly, not just mod p^c), diag(k,1) in K_1(p^c) for every c \u003e= 0. In particular diag(k,1) in K_1(p^{c(Pi)}). Since W^circ is the new vector of Pi, it is right-K_1(p^{c(Pi)})-invariant: W^circ(g diag(k,1)) = W^circ(g) for all g in GL_{n+1}(F), k in K_n. Applying this with g = diag(a,1): W^circ(diag(ak,1)) = W^circ(diag(a,1) diag(k,1)) = W^circ(diag(a,1)). Therefore W^circ factors out of the K-integral, giving J(m) = W^circ(diag(a,1)) * J_K(m) where J_K(m) = int_{K_n} psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} k_{nn}) V^circ(ak) dk.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"8f62a2eedb90bb212b79e0bb3233adb49072baf3f2fbb94a3836ed91b9bcefc4","created":"2026-02-09T13:23:37.853919024Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
