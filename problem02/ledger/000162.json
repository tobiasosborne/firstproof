Specifically:\n\nf(sigma_Pi tensor sigma_pi) = f_Artin(sigma_Pi tensor sigma_pi) + Swan(sigma_Pi tensor sigma_pi)\n\nFor tame representations (where the Swan conductor is 0), f_Artin suffices. But for wildly ramified representations (which include many supercuspidal representations when the residue characteristic is small), the Swan conductor is nonzero and must be included.\n\nMoreover, the coefficient of a(psi) in the correct formula is dim(sigma_Pi tensor sigma_pi) = dim(sigma_Pi) * dim(sigma_pi) = (n+1) * n = n(n+1) = n^2 + n. So the coefficient n^2 + n is correct for this term. However, the node writes 'f_Artin' where it should write 'f' (the full conductor including the Swan part). This is a meaningful error in the non-tame case.\n\nFor the PROBLEM STATEMENT's purposes (which concerns arbitrary generic pi), pi can be wildly ramified, so this distinction matters. The formula as stated is only correct in the tamely ramified case.\n\nNote: This error does not affect the logical validity of Case 3 (the epsilon factor is still a monomial regardless of the specific exponent formula), but it makes the 'explicit values' section incorrect as written.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
