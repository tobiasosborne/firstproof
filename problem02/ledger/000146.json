At minimum, it should depend on the external references it cites and on any upstream nodes whose results it uses.\n\n(2) INFERENCE TYPE IS 'assumption' BUT THE NODE PERFORMS A DERIVATION. The node is NOT postulating a hypothesis -- it claims to DERIVE the finiteness of the torus sum and the monomial property from:\n- The Langlands classification\n- Matringe 2013 explicit formulas\n- JPSS rationality theory\n- The functional equation and epsilon factor theory\n\nA multi-step derivation using external theorems and the Langlands classification is an 'inference' or 'derivation,' not an 'assumption.' The inference type should be corrected to reflect the actual logical role of this node.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
