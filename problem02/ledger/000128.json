But the node is NOT postulating a hypothesis — it claims to DERIVE the nonvanishing of I(s) from:\n- JPSS 1983 (Step 1: rationality and functional equation)\n- The monomial structure of epsilon factors (Step 2)\n- Test vector theory (Step 3, citing Humphries 2021 and Assing-Blomer 2024)\n- Node 1.4.4.2 (finiteness of the torus sum)\n- Node 1.2 (algebraic characterization of monomials)\n- Node 1.5.1 (K-integral nonvanishing)\n\nA four-step argument using external theorems and internal dependency nodes is a derivation, not an assumption. The inference type should reflect the actual logical role of this node in the proof tree.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
