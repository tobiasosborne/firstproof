The Kirillov model K(pi, psi) is realized on a space of locally constant functions on F^{n-1} \\ {0}. By Bernstein-Zelevinsky, S(F^{n-1} \\ {0}) embeds into K(pi, psi). Define phi_0 = char(o^{n-1} \\ p o^{n-1}), the characteristic function of the set {(x_1,...,x_{n-1}) in o^{n-1} : max_i |x_i| = 1} (i.e., tuples in o^{n-1} with at least one unit coordinate). Then phi_0 in S(F^{n-1} \\ {0}) subset K(pi, psi). Let V_0 in W(pi, psi) be the Whittaker function corresponding to phi_0 under the Kirillov isomorphism.\n\nKey properties of V_0:\n(P1) V_0 has compact support modulo N_n on GL_n(F). Specifically, in the Iwasawa decomposition g = nak with a = diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_n}), the Kirillov restriction of V_0 is supported on {a : m_1 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_{n-1} \u003e= 0 and m_{n-1} = 0}, which means m_i \u003e= 0 for all i and m_{n-1} = 0. Combined with support from phi_0, the torus support is finite once |det a|^{s-1/2} contributes the s-dependence, because the Casselman-Shalika support constraint from W^circ on the GL_{n+1}-side bounds m_1,...,m_{n-2} from above.\n(P2) V_0 is right-K_0(p)-invariant (invariant under the Iwahori-level subgroup), which is a weaker invariance than V^circ (which is K-fixed), but sufficient for the Iwasawa integral computation.\n\nThe proof that the RS integral with W = W^circ and V = V_0 is a nonzero monomial for unramified pi is given in Node 1.3.2.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"55b482bd57f97249e2f216f81a56e963207b83b7460285bcbb021495576502e4","created":"2026-02-09T13:00:23.177393725Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
