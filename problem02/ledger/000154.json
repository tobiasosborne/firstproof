But Node 1.5 is NOT an assumption -- it claims to DERIVE the nonvanishing of I(s) from:\n- Node 1.2 (algebraic characterization of monomials)\n- Node 1.3 (test vector choices)\n- Node 1.4 (Iwasawa unfolding), including sub-nodes 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3, 1.4.4.1, 1.4.4.2\n- Child Node 1.5.1 (K-integral nonvanishing for supercuspidal case)\n- Child Node 1.5.2 (epsilon factor identification for non-supercuspidal case)\n- External references: Matringe 2013 Theorem 3.1, JPSS 1983\n\nThe statement explicitly describes a case-split argument (Case A / Case B) that combines internal node results with external citations. This is a derivation, not an assumption. The inference type should be changed to reflect the actual logical role of this node.\n\nThis matters for the proof framework: an 'assumption' node is accepted as a postulate (requiring only that it is mathematically consistent), while a derivation node must have its logical steps verified against its premises. Mislabeling a derivation as an assumption bypasses the verification that the conclusion actually follows from the premises.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
