If I(s) is a Laurent polynomial and I(s) = P(q^{-s}) * L(s, Pi x pi), then P(q^{-s}) = I(s) / L(s, Pi x pi) = I(s) * L(s, Pi x pi)^{-1}.\n\nNow L(s, Pi x pi)^{-1} is a polynomial in q^{-s} (it is a finite product of factors (1 - alpha_j q^{-s})). So P(q^{-s}) = (Laurent polynomial) * (polynomial), which is indeed a Laurent polynomial. So far so good -- but this makes step (B) a TAUTOLOGY, not an informative decomposition.\n\nThe JPSS decomposition I(s) = P(q^{-s}) * L(s, Pi x pi) is informative when I(s) is a priori only known to be a rational function of q^{-s} (the JPSS theorem says it is rational, and the factorization identifies the L-function as the denominator). But if I(s) is already known to be a Laurent polynomial (no poles), then the decomposition just says I(s) = (I(s)/L) * L, which is vacuous.\n\nMore importantly, the monomial argument in steps (A)-(C) is structured as: (A) I(s) is in the JPSS family, (B) it decomposes as P * L, (C) the functional equation plus epsilon factor identification pins down P. But the JPSS decomposition P * L typically has P as a POLYNOMIAL (not Laurent polynomial) in q^{-s}, and the JPSS theorem is: for ANY W in W(Pi, psi^{-1}) and V in W(pi, psi), Psi(s, W, V) = P_{W,V}(q^{-s}) * L(s, Pi x pi) for some P_{W,V} in C[q^s, q^{-s}]. The fact that I(s) is a Laurent polynomial does not by itself yield the monomial property -- you need additional structural information about P, which is exactly what step (C) is supposed to provide but fails to.\n\nThe node should clarify: (i) what exactly the JPSS decomposition adds beyond tautology given that I(s) is already a Laurent polynomial, and (ii) how P being forced to be a monomial (which would make I(s) a monomial times L, not a monomial itself unless L = 1 or L is also a monomial, which it is not in general).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
