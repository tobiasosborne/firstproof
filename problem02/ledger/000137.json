This alternative proposes constructing a modified test vector V_mod with Kirillov function phi_mod = char(C_Q) having compact support chosen to collapse the torus sum to a single term.\n\nThe node explicitly states: 'The construction of such phi_mod and the nonvanishing verification are deferred to a child node.'\n\nHowever, NO SUCH CHILD NODE EXISTS. Node 1.4.4.2 has no children in the proof tree. The deferred construction is therefore a promissory note with no backing.\n\nThis means BOTH proof paths for the monomial property are incomplete:\n- Path 1 (epsilon factor identification via step C): Self-acknowledged as 'subject of ongoing work.'\n- Path 2 (alternative V_mod construction): Deferred to a child node that does not exist.\n\nThe node therefore establishes at most that the torus sum is FINITE (i.e., I(s) is a Laurent polynomial), but does NOT establish the monomial property. The finiteness claim is the only rigorous content of the node, and it is insufficient for the purposes of the proof (which requires I(s) to be a monomial, not merely a Laurent polynomial).\n\nUntil either (a) step (C) is rigorously established with proper citations, or (b) the child node with the V_mod construction is created and verified, the monomial property for non-supercuspidal ramified pi remains unproven.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
