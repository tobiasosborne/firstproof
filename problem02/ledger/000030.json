A Gauss sum is standardly an integral of the form int chi(x) psi(x) dx where chi is a multiplicative character and psi is additive, both on the SAME one-dimensional group. The actual K-integral (after factoring out W^circ, see below) is:\n\n  int_{GL_n(O)} psi^{-1}(Q a_n k_{nn}) V^circ(ak) dk\n\nThis integral is over GL_n(O) (an n^2-dimensional compact group), the additive twist depends on one entry k_{nn}, and V^circ(ak) is a Whittaker function depending on ALL n^2 entries of k. For n \u003e= 2, this is emphatically NOT a Gauss sum but rather a matrix coefficient integral with a partial additive twist.\n\nOne important structural fact the node fails to state: diag(k, 1) lies in K_1(p^{c(Pi)}) for ALL k in GL_n(O), because the last row of diag(k,1) is (0,...,0,1), which trivially satisfies the K_1 congruence condition. Therefore W^circ(diag(ak,1)) = W^circ(diag(a,1)) is INDEPENDENT of k, and W^circ factors out of the K-integral. This simplification is essential for the conductor analysis but is never stated.\n\nEven with W^circ factored out, the remaining integral over GL_n(O) is not a Gauss sum for n \u003e= 2. To connect it to Gauss sums, one would need to (a) decompose the integral by first integrating over fibers where k_{nn} is fixed, (b) show the fiber integral of V^circ yields a function of k_{nn} that transforms as a character, and (c) reduce to a one-variable integral. None of these steps appear in the node. Without this reduction, the three-case conductor analysis for cases (a)-(c) lacks a rigorous foundation because the analysis of ψ^{-1}(Q a_n k_{nn}) varying with k_{nn} ignores the simultaneous variation of V^circ(ak) with all entries of k.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
