But the Kirillov coordinates of ak (for a = diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_{n-1}},1) and k in K_n) are NOT simply (varpi^{m_1} f_1(k),...,varpi^{m_{n-1}} f_{n-1}(k)) as claimed without justification.\n\nThe precise relationship between ak and Kirillov coordinates requires specifying the Kirillov model embedding explicitly. The Kirillov model realizes pi on functions phi: F^{n-1} setminus {0} -\u003e C via the mirabolic subgroup P_n. For g in GL_n, the action is (pi(g)phi)(x) = (something involving the representation action). The value V^circ(ak) in the Whittaker model corresponds to evaluating a TRANSFORMED version of phi^circ, not simply evaluating phi^circ at scaled coordinates.\n\nSpecifically: W^ess(ak) for k in K_n involves the RIGHT K_n-translate of the Whittaker function. In the Kirillov model, this corresponds to the action of k on phi^circ: (pi(k)phi^circ)(x_1,...,x_{n-1}). Since K_n = GL_n(o) acts on S(F^{n-1} setminus {0}) by a representation (not just by coordinate scaling), the transformed function pi(k)phi^circ can have DIFFERENT support than phi^circ itself. The group K_n acts transitively on many orbits in F^{n-1}, so the K_n-orbit of supp(phi^circ) can be much larger than supp(phi^circ).\n\nTherefore: even if supp(phi^circ) were contained in a single torus coset (which it is not, per the critical challenge), the integral int_{K_n} V^circ(ak) dk would involve evaluating pi(k)phi^circ at the point corresponding to a, and the support condition on phi^circ does NOT directly translate to a simple support condition on the integrand as a function of (m_1,...,m_{n-1}).\n\nThe node should provide: (1) The precise definition of Kirillov coordinates for the element ak. (2) A rigorous derivation of why the integrand vanishes for given (m_1,...,m_{n-1}), accounting for the K_n-action.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
