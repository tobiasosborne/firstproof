The logical implication 'vanishing Jacquet modules =\u003e Kirillov function supported on single torus coset' does NOT hold.\n\n(1) WHAT VANISHING JACQUET MODULES ACTUALLY IMPLIES: For supercuspidal pi of GL_n, r_P(pi) = 0 for the mirabolic P. By Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory, this means K(pi) = S(F^{n-1} setminus {0}), i.e., the Kirillov model consists of ALL locally constant compactly supported functions on F^{n-1} setminus {0}. Since K(pi) = S(F^{n-1} setminus {0}) is the FULL Schwartz space, ANY compactly supported locally constant function can appear. In particular, V^circ = phi^circ is SOME specific element of this space, determined by the K_0(p^c) fixed vector condition. But the vanishing Jacquet module characterizes the SPACE, not the support of any particular vector.\n\n(2) COUNTEREXAMPLE FOR GL_2: Let pi be a depth-zero supercuspidal of GL_2(F) with conductor p (c(pi) = 1). The Kirillov model is S(F^x). The new vector phi^circ in S(F^x) is a locally constant, compactly supported function on F^x that is fixed by K_0(p). This function is NOT the characteristic function of a single coset varpi^{-L} o^x. Explicitly, for depth-zero supercuspidals arising from cuspidal representations of GL_2(k_F), the new vector in the Kirillov model has support containing elements with val(x) = 0 and potentially val(x) = -1, i.e., it lives on at least two cosets of o^x.\n\n(3) CONFUSION BETWEEN KIRILLOV SUPPORT AND WHITTAKER TORUS RESTRICTION: The node conflates two different objects: (a) supp(phi^circ) as a subset of F^{n-1} setminus {0} in the Kirillov model, and (b) the torus support {m : W^ess(diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_n})) != 0}. These are DIFFERENT. The Kirillov function phi^circ(x_1,...,x_{n-1}) and the Whittaker torus value W^ess(diag(a_1,...,a_n)) are related by a change-of-model isomorphism that involves integration/summation, NOT by simple evaluation. Specifically, the Kirillov embedding sends W to the function phi where phi(x) = W(p(x)) with p(x) the mirabolic element -- this is a RESTRICTION to the mirabolic, not to the torus.\n\n(4) WHY THIS MATTERS: This single-coset claim is the linchpin of the single-term argument. Without it, the intersection of V^circ support with W^circ dominance gives a FINITE but potentially MULTI-TERM sum. For the conclusion I(s) = constant to hold, one needs either (a) to show the sum genuinely has one term (requiring a different argument), or (b) to show the multi-term sum is still a monomial (requiring all terms to have the same s-power, which needs proof).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
