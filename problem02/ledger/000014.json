This is a classical result: for GL_1, it is Tate thesis; for GL_n, it follows from the Godement-Jacquet theory of local epsilon factors. The essential Whittaker function value W^circ(diag(a,1)) at the selected torus element is nonzero by the Matringe-Miyauchi explicit formula.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"cf51a32c78874aa1264f8a7b5ffb4eabfe7c904bf21632d849f40bce0e90d628","created":"2026-02-09T11:55:04.17093619Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
