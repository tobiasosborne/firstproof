This is straightforward and verified.\n\nHowever, the nonvanishing argument has the wrong logical structure for n \u003e= 2:\n\nFor GL_1: The Gauss sum tau(chi, psi_Q) = int_{O*} chi(x) psi_Q(x) d*x is nonzero PRECISELY WHEN cond(chi) = cond(psi_Q). When conductors mismatch, the integral is zero by orthogonality. So conductor matching is the KEY MECHANISM for GL_1 -- it is both necessary and sufficient for nonvanishing.\n\nFor GL_n (n \u003e= 2): The Godement-Jacquet epsilon factor epsilon(s, pi, psi) is ALWAYS nonzero -- for ANY choice of psi, regardless of the relationship between the conductors of psi and pi. The epsilon factor is a unit in C[q^s, q^{-s}]. So \"conductor matching\" is NOT the mechanism that produces nonvanishing for n \u003e= 2 -- the nonvanishing holds unconditionally.\n\nThe node incorrectly presents conductor matching as the reason for nonvanishing across all n. For n \u003e= 2, the correct reasoning is simply: the epsilon factor is always nonzero (this is a theorem of Godement-Jacquet). No conductor matching is needed. The node conflates the GL_1 mechanism with the general mechanism.\n\nThis does not affect the truth of the claimed nonvanishing (epsilon factors ARE nonzero), but the stated reasoning is wrong, which obscures the true mathematical structure and may cause downstream confusion.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
