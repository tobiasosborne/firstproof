After Iwasawa decomposition g = nak on GL_n(F) and assuming the torus sum collapses to a single term at a* = diag(varpi^{m_1*}, ..., varpi^{m_n*}) (as claimed by Node 1.4), the surviving term of the integral is:\n\n  delta_B^{-1}(a*) * |det a*|^{s-1/2} * W^circ(diag(a*,1)) * (K-integral at a*)\n\nSeparating the s-dependent and s-independent parts of |det a*|^{s-1/2}:\n  |det a*|^{s-1/2} = |det a*|^s * |det a*|^{-1/2} = q^{-k*s} * q^{k*/2}\nwhere k* = m_1* + ... + m_n*.\n\nSo the full expression is:\n  [delta_B^{-1}(a*) * q^{k*/2} * W^circ(diag(a*,1)) * (K-integral at a*)] * q^{-k*s}\n\nThe constant c(Pi,pi) therefore includes FOUR factors:\n  (i)   delta_B^{-1}(a*) -- the inverse Borel modular character\n  (ii)  q^{k*/2} -- from the |det|^{-1/2} part\n  (iii) W^circ(diag(a*,1)) -- the torus value of the Whittaker function\n  (iv)  K-integral at a* -- claimed to be a Gauss sum by Node 1.5\n\nThe node lists only factors (iii) and (iv), omitting (i) and (ii).\n\nFor n = 1 (GL(2) x GL(1)), the conductor analysis forces m_1 = 0, so a* = 1, giving delta_B^{-1}(1) = 1 and q^{0/2} = 1. The omitted factors happen to be trivial, and the factorization c = (Gauss sum) x (W^circ(I_2)) is accidentally correct.\n\nFor n \u003e= 2 (contingent on the torus collapse, which is separately challenged in Node 1.4), the torus element a* would have nontrivial coordinates, and the omitted factors delta_B^{-1}(a*) and q^{k*/2} would be nontrivial nonzero constants. Their omission makes the factorization incorrect.\n\nWhile all factors are nonzero (so c(Pi,pi) \\!= 0 is unaffected), the stated factorization is wrong as written. A correct statement should either list all factors or simply say 'c(Pi,pi) is a product of nonzero quantities from the Gauss sum, the Whittaker function torus value, and the Iwasawa decomposition measure factors.'","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
