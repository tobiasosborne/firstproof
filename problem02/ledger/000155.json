But Node 1.4.4 is the 'Torus Sum Reduction and Monomial Property' node. The fiber decomposition of the K-integral is actually performed in Node 1.4.3 ('Conductor Analysis and Fiber Decomposition of the K-integral'). This appears to be a cross-reference error. The parent should reference Node 1.4.3, not Node 1.4.4.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
