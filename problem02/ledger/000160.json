This phrasing is ambiguous and potentially misleading.\n\nTwo distinct properties are at play:\n(P1) I(s) is not the zero function (i.e., there exists some s_0 with I(s_0) \\!= 0).\n(P2) I(s) \\!= 0 for EVERY s in C (i.e., I has no zeros at all).\n\nThese are very different. A nonzero polynomial has property (P1) but typically fails (P2). The proof actually needs (P2) -- or more precisely, needs I(s) to be a nonzero monomial c * q^{-ks} (which automatically satisfies P2 since |q^{-ks}| \u003e 0 for all s in C).\n\nFor Case A (supercuspidal), the argument does establish that I(s) = W^circ(I_{n+1}) * J_K(0,...,0) is a nonzero CONSTANT, so (P2) holds trivially.\n\nFor Case B (non-supercuspidal), the argument claims I(s) is a nonzero monomial. If this were established (it is not, per the critical challenge on Case B), then (P2) would hold. But the statement should be precise about what is being proved: I(s) is a nonzero monomial in q^{-s}, not merely that it is 'nonzero for each value of s.' The monomial property is strictly stronger than (P2) and is what is actually needed for the proof strategy of Node 1.2.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
