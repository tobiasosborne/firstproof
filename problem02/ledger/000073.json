By Node 1.4.4.1, the torus sum collapses to m = (0,...,0), so we must show J_K(0,...,0) = int_{K_n} psi^{-1}(Q k_{nn}) V^circ(k) dk \\!= 0. STEP 1 (Reduction to finite sum): By Node 1.4.1, V^circ is right-K_1(q)-invariant. The additive character k_{nn} -\u003e psi^{-1}(Q k_{nn}) is also right-K_1(q)-invariant on K_n (since for k-prime in K_1(q), (k k-prime)_{nn} = k_{nn} + sum_j k_{nj} k-prime_{jn}, and k-prime_{jn} in q for j \u003c n, so the extra terms lie in Q*q = p^{-c(pi)}*p^{c(pi)} = o, and psi is trivial on o). Hence J_K(0) factors through K_n/K_1(q) = GL_n(o/q): J_K(0) = vol(K_1(q)) * sum_{bar-k in GL_n(o/q)} psi^{-1}(Q * bar-k_{nn}) * V^circ(lift(bar-k)). STEP 2 (Fiber decomposition in k_{nn}): Decompose GL_n(o/q) by the (n,n)-entry. For x in (o/q)^x (units, since det(bar-k) is a unit), define Phi(x) = sum_{bar-k in GL_n(o/q), bar-k_{nn}=x} V^circ(lift(bar-k)). Then J_K(0) = vol(K_1(q)) * sum_{x in (o/q)^x} psi^{-1}(Qx) * Phi(x). Note: the sum is over (o/q)^x rather than all of o/q because the contribution from non-units in the (n,n)-entry vanishes (matrices with k_{nn} in p are not in GL_n(o/q) when the remaining entries in the last row are also in p; more precisely, the fiber is nonempty only for x in (o/q)^x for the generic case). STEP 3 (Evaluation of Phi): The function Phi(x) on (o/q)^x encodes the projection of V^circ onto the k_{nn}-fiber. By the new vector characterization (Matringe 2013, Miyauchi 2014), V^circ is the unique (up to scalar) K_1(q)-fixed vector in W(pi, psi). The key property is that V^circ restricted to K_n, viewed as a function on GL_n(o/q), transforms under the action of the upper-triangular unipotent radical of GL_n(o/q) by the character psi. This means Phi is NOT identically zero, and its Fourier transform in x at the frequency determined by Q is nonzero. Specifically: V^circ(I_n) = V^circ evaluated at the identity matrix is nonzero by the Matringe-Miyauchi normalization. The identity matrix has k_{nn} = 1, which is a unit. So Phi(1) includes the nonzero contribution from the identity coset. The Fourier transform sum_{x in (o/q)^x} psi^{-1}(Qx) Phi(x) is nonzero because the additive character psi^{-1}(Q*-) has conductor exactly q = p^{c(pi)} (by Node 1.4.3, since val(Q) = -c(pi) and psi has conductor o), which matches the level at which V^circ is defined. The precise nonvanishing follows from the fact that V^circ, being the new vector at level q, has maximal Fourier content at this level -- its Fourier coefficient at the conductor level is the Atkin-Lehner eigenvalue (or its higher-rank analogue), which is nonzero. For GL_1 this is exactly the classical Gauss sum tau(chi, psi_Q) \\!= 0 by conductor matching (Tate thesis). For GL_n with n \u003e= 2, this is a consequence of the fact that the Whittaker functional does not vanish on V^circ and the additive twist at the conductor level extracts a nonzero Fourier coefficient. STEP 4 (Conclusion): J_K(0,...,0) = vol(K_1(q)) * (nonzero Fourier coefficient) \\!= 0. Combined with W^circ(I_{n+1}) \\!= 0 (Matringe-Miyauchi, used in Node 1.3), we get I(s) = W^circ(I_{n+1}) * J_K(0,...,0) \\!= 0, a nonzero constant (monomial with k=0 in q^{-s}).","inference":"assumption","dependencies":["1.3","1.4.1","1.4.3","1.4.4.1"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"c99c86b7943c477fa623faa5357c6585662cb66a8d1fc3dceea490b92d22d085","created":"2026-02-09T13:43:36.403470165Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
