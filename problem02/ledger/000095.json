Setting aside the Kirillov coordinate error (ch-76fbc55cac56bda8), there is a deeper structural obstruction to the entire strategy of Node 1.3 for unramified pi.\n\nAfter the twist is removed (which is valid for m_n \u003e= 0, covering the dominant cone), the K-integral at step (iv) becomes J(a) = int_{K_n} V_0(ak) dk. This is exactly the K-PROJECTION of V_0 evaluated at a: (Proj_K V_0)(a) = int_{K_n} pi(k) V_0 dk evaluated at a.\n\nFor unramified pi, the K-fixed subspace of W(pi, psi) is 1-dimensional, spanned by the spherical Whittaker function V^circ. Therefore Proj_K(V_0) = c * V^circ for some constant c in C. This gives J(a) = c * V^circ(a) for ALL torus elements a (not just a = I_n).\n\nDILEMMA:\n(Horn 1) If c \\!= 0: Then J(a) = c * V^circ(a), and the RS integral becomes I(s) = c * sum_m W^circ(diag(a,1)) V^circ(a) |det a|^{s-1/2} delta_B^{-1}(a), at least for the terms with m_n \u003e= 0 where the twist vanishes. For unramified Pi, this sum (restricted to the dominant cone) is exactly c * L(s, Pi x pi), which has poles and is NOT a monomial. For ramified Pi with non-compact support, the sum over m_n \u003e= 0 still involves infinitely many terms with J(a) = c * V^circ(a), generically producing a rational function with poles.\n\n(Horn 2) If c = 0: Then Proj_K(V_0) = 0, meaning int_{K_n} V_0(ak) dk = 0 for ALL a including a = I_n. In particular, J(I_n) = 0, and the claimed nonvanishing I(s) = W^circ(I_{n+1}) * int_{K_n} V_0(k) dk \\!= 0 FAILS because the integral is zero.\n\nRESOLUTION OF THE DILEMMA REQUIRES: Either (a) showing that the twist psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} k_{nn}) is NOT trivial on the relevant support (but for m_n \u003e= 0 it IS trivial, so this fails); or (b) showing that the torus sum genuinely collapses to a single term BEFORE applying K-projection (but this requires the Kirillov identification, which is wrong); or (c) an entirely different choice of test vector V_0 that avoids K-projection issues.\n\nThe node does not address this dilemma at all. The argument implicitly assumes J(a) = 0 for a \\!= I_n via the Kirillov identification, thereby avoiding the K-projection. But once the Kirillov identification is removed, the K-projection makes the monomial claim impossible for the given V_0.\n\nThis is closely related to challenge ch-0a34647688bb785b on Node 1.3.1 but here it is applied specifically to Node 1.3.2's final computation.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
