The argument V_0(ak) = phi_0(varpi^{m_1} k_{1n}, ..., varpi^{m_{n-1}} k_{n-1,n}) is FALSE for k outside P_n. For a positive-measure subset of K_n (the big Bruhat cell elements not in P_n), evaluating V_0(ak) requires the FULL representation action pi(k), involving nontrivial intertwining operators. This invalidates both the torus collapse argument and the K-integral computation.\n\n(B) ch-8a091889d3aeb3fb on Node 1.3.2 [critical]: The K-PROJECTION DILEMMA. After removing the twist (which is trivial for the unramified case), J(a) = int_{K_n} V_0(ak) dk = Proj_K(V_0)(a). For unramified pi, Proj_K(V_0) = c * V^circ for some constant c. If c != 0, then I(s) = c * (standard RS integral with new vectors) = c * L(s, Pi x pi), which has poles. If c = 0, then J(I_n) = 0 and the nonvanishing claim fails. In either horn of the dilemma, the argument breaks down.\n\n(C) ch-b23b0a145f13161b on Node 1.3.1 [critical]: The Casselman-Shalika formula is invoked for the torus support of W^circ, but this formula applies ONLY to unramified Pi. For ramified Pi, W^circ is the new vector at level c(Pi), and its torus support is NOT described by the Casselman-Shalika formula. Since the problem requires the result for ALL generic Pi (including ramified), the torus collapse m_i \u003e= 0 from the GL_{n+1}-side is not established for ramified Pi.\n\nNode 1.6 merely restates the conclusions of Nodes 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 without addressing these fundamental gaps. A QED node cannot assert conclusions from broken upstream arguments. The entire Case 1 argument is unsound until these challenges are resolved.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
