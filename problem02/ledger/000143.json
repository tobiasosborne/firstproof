Explicit counterexample: the permutation matrix transposing coordinates n-1 and n lies in GL_n(o/q), has determinant -1, and has bar-k_{nn} = 0. The correct sum is over ALL of o/q, not just units.\n(b) ch-3463f8fdc17 (critical, gap): The nonvanishing of the Fourier sum in Step 3 is asserted WITHOUT proof for n \u003e= 2. The stated argument is circular: 'the additive twist at the conductor level extracts a nonzero Fourier coefficient' IS the statement to be proved. The invocations of 'maximal Fourier content at the conductor level' (undefined), 'Atkin-Lehner eigenvalue or its higher-rank analogue' (undefined for n \u003e= 2), and 'the Whittaker functional does not vanish on V^circ' (irrelevant to the specific Fourier coefficient) do not constitute a proof.\n\nThe result NV2 is therefore NOT established. Node 1.5 treats it as proven ('proved in child Node 1.5.1'), but the child node's proof is critically flawed. This is not a gap that can be dismissed as a technicality -- the entire supercuspidal case of Node 1.5 rests on NV2, and NV2 is unproven.\n\nImportantly, even the APPROACH of Node 1.5.1 has structural problems: the Fourier-analytic method requires understanding the restriction of V^circ to GL_n(o/q) as a representation of the finite group, and the relevant nonvanishing is related to the epsilon factor of the cuspidal representation of GL_n(F_q) induced by pi. This connection is never made in 1.5.1.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
