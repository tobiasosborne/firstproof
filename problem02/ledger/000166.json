The node's Case 2 (unramified pi) describes the Kirillov model as \"locally constant functions on F^x\" and defines V_0 via phi_0 = char(o^x). It then verifies the n=1 (GL_2 x GL_1) case. However, for n=1, pi is a character chi: F^x -\u003e C^x of GL_1(F) = F^x. The Whittaker model W(chi, psi) is the representation space of chi, which is one-dimensional: W(chi, psi) = {c * chi : c in C}. The function V_0 = char(o^x) is NOT a scalar multiple of any character chi of F^x (characters are nonzero everywhere on F^x, while char(o^x) vanishes outside o^x). Therefore V_0 is NOT in W(chi, psi).\n\nROOT CAUSE: For n \u003e= 2, the Kirillov model K(pi, psi) is an infinite-dimensional space of locally constant functions on F^{n-1}\\{0} that contains S(F^{n-1}\\{0}) by Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory. For n=1, the representation pi = chi of GL_1(F) = F^x is one-dimensional. The \"Kirillov model\" is just C*chi. The Schwartz space S(F^x) does NOT embed into a one-dimensional space. The node's construction \"phi_0 = char(o^x) in S(F^x) subset K(pi, psi)\" fails for n=1.\n\nCONSEQUENCE: The n=1 computation claiming the sum collapses to m=0 uses phi_0(varpi^m) = 0 for m != 0, but phi_0 is not in W(chi, psi). The actual integral with V = c*chi (the only valid choice) for unramified chi and unramified Pi reduces to c * L(s, Pi x chi), which has poles. The n=1 case requires either a different W (not W^circ) with compact torus support, or a fundamentally different argument.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
