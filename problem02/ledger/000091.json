The node claims: J(I_n) = int_{K_n} V_0(k) dk = int_{K_n} phi_0(k_{1n},...,k_{n-1,n}) dk = vol({k in K_n : all k_{in} in o^x for i \u003c n}).\n\nThis computation assumes V_0(k) = phi_0(k_{1n},...,k_{n-1,n}) for all k in K_n, which is the same incorrect Kirillov coordinate identification challenged in ch-fc31ed059f008e23. For k not in P_n (e.g., k with k_{n,j} != 0 for some j \u003c n, which is the generic case), V_0(k) is NOT simply phi_0 evaluated at the last-column entries.\n\nEven if one could show J(I_n) \u003e 0 by a different argument, a separate concern must be addressed: the K-average int_{K_n} V_0(ak) dk equals the K-projection of V_0 evaluated at a. For unramified pi, the K-fixed subspace of W(pi, psi) is 1-dimensional, spanned by V^circ. So Proj_K(V_0) = c * V^circ for some constant c. If c != 0, then int_K V_0(ak) dk = c * V^circ(a) for ALL a, not just a = I_n. This means the full Rankin-Selberg integral would equal c * (standard RS integral with new vectors) = c * L(s, Pi x pi), which generically has poles and is NOT a monomial.\n\nFor the strategy to work, either: (1) the K-projection of V_0 must be ZERO (i.e., V_0 is orthogonal to the spherical vector in some pairing), in which case J(I_n) = c * V^circ(I_n) = 0 and the nonvanishing claim fails; or (2) the K-integral does NOT reduce to c * V^circ(a) because the psi-twist in the integrand prevents the K-projection argument from applying. But Node 1.3.2 shows the twist is trivial for m_n \u003e= 0 (which covers all Casselman-Shalika support), so option (2) does not apply.\n\nThis creates a dilemma: if Proj_K(V_0) != 0, the integral is not a monomial; if Proj_K(V_0) = 0, the K-integral at I_n vanishes and (P3) fails. The node must address this.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
