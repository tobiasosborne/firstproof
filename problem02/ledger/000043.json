This universality claim is NOT merely inherited from upstream nodes -- it is a NEW assertion made exclusively by Node 1.6, going beyond what nodes 1.1-1.5 individually claim.\n\nThe claim is false for unramified pi (c(pi) = 0):\n\n(1) When c(pi) = 0, the conductor ideal is q = o, so Q generates o^{-1} = o, meaning Q is a unit (val(Q) = 0).\n\n(2) With Q a unit, the additive character psi_Q(x) = psi(Qx) has conductor o (same as psi). There is no 'conductor matching' in any meaningful sense because psi_Q and psi are essentially equivalent.\n\n(3) The twist psi^{-1}(Q g_{nn}) from Node 1.1 is trivial for g_{nn} in o (since Q is a unit and psi has conductor o). On the support of the spherical Whittaker function V^circ (which is K-fixed), the twist acts trivially on GL_n(O). The integral then reduces to the standard (untwisted) Rankin-Selberg integral with new vectors.\n\n(4) The standard RS integral with new vectors equals L(s, Pi x pi) (JPSS theory). For generic Pi (e.g., non-supercuspidal), L(s, Pi x pi) has poles and is NOT a monomial.\n\n(5) The HANDOFF.md file explicitly acknowledges this failure (lines 82-83): 'Unramified Case (c(pi) = 0) -- Special Handling: When pi is unramified... If W = W^circ produces L(s, Pi x pi) (which may have poles), choose V != V^circ from W(pi, psi) with compact Kirillov support to get a monomial instead.'\n\nWhile the unramified failure is identified upstream at Node 1.3, Node 1.6 makes a STRONGER claim than any upstream node by asserting universality. This new assertion contradicts the known failure mode. A correct QED should acknowledge the case split: the Gauss sum mechanism works for ramified pi (c(pi) \u003e= 1), while the unramified case requires a different choice of V.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
