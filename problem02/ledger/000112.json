The potential cancellation among multiple torus terms is prevented by the sign structure of W^circ (whose torus values are related to Schur polynomials or their ramified analogues).'\n\nThis reasoning contains a fundamental mathematical error when I(s) has more than one term.\n\nTHE ERROR: The node conflates 'no individual term vanishes' with 'the sum has no zeros.' For a Laurent polynomial I(s) = sum_k c_k q^{-ks} with multiple nonzero coefficients c_k at distinct exponents k, the function I(s) WILL have zeros on C*. This is an immediate consequence of the fundamental theorem of algebra: setting z = q^{-s}, the polynomial sum_k c_k z^k has finitely many roots in C*, and since s -\u003e q^{-s} = exp(-s log q) surjects onto C*, there exist s_0 in C with I(s_0) = 0.\n\nCONCRETE EXAMPLE: Suppose the torus sum (for non-supercuspidal ramified pi) has two contributing exponents, giving I(s) = c_0 + c_1 q^{-s} with c_0, c_1 in C*. Then I(s_0) = 0 when q^{-s_0} = -c_0/c_1, which is a nonzero complex number. Such s_0 exists. No 'sign structure' prevents this, because q^{-s} is a complex variable that takes ALL values in C*.\n\nFor the SUPERCUSPIDAL case: Child 1.4.4.1 proves the torus sum collapses to one term (m_1 = ... = m_{n-1} = 0), so I(s) = (nonzero constant), trivially no zeros. The sign structure argument is unnecessary.\n\nFor the NON-SUPERCUSPIDAL case: Child 1.4.4.2 states: 'Each term contributes c_m * q^{-|m| s}. The resulting I(s) is a FINITE Laurent polynomial in q^{-s}.' A finite Laurent polynomial with multiple terms at distinct exponents has zeros on C*. For I(s) to be a monomial, the sum must have EXACTLY ONE contributing exponent -- meaning either (a) only one tuple (m_1,...,m_{n-1}) contributes, or (b) all contributing tuples have the same sum m_1+...+m_{n-1} AND their coefficients sum to nonzero. Neither condition is established here.\n\nThe 'sign structure' argument does not address whether multiple distinct exponents contribute. For non-supercuspidal pi = Ind(Delta_1 x ... x Delta_r), the Matringe torus support of V^circ generically includes multiple points with different coordinate sums (e.g., for GL_3 x GL_2 with pi a ramified principal series, the sum over m_1 with m_1 \u003e= 0 can include m_1 = 0, 1, 2, ... giving distinct powers of q^{-s}).\n\nNode 1.4.4.2 attempts to fix this via epsilon factor identification (I(s) = C * epsilon(s, Pi x pi, psi)), but 1.4.4.2 explicitly says this is 'the subject of ongoing work.' The alternative V_mod construction is deferred to an unwritten child node.\n\nCONCLUSION: The parent node's zero analysis is logically broken for non-supercuspidal pi. The argument 'leading term nonzero + sign structure prevents cancellation =\u003e no zeros' is a non sequitur because the correct requirement is 'exactly one exponent in the Laurent polynomial,' which is strictly stronger and not implied by sign structure considerations.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
