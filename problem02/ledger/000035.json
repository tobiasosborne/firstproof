This is Tate thesis.\n\nFor GL_n with n \u003e= 2, pi is a REPRESENTATION (an infinite-dimensional vector space with a GL_n(F)-action), NOT a character. The phrase \"the multiplicative character of pi\" is undefined. Possible interpretations:\n\n(A) The central character omega_pi : F* -\u003e C*. But cond(omega_pi) != c(pi) in general. Example: pi = chi_1 x chi_2 on GL_2 with chi_1 of conductor p and chi_2 unramified. Then c(pi) = 1 but omega_pi = chi_1 * chi_2 has conductor depending on chi_1 * chi_2 (could be 0 if chi_2 = chi_1^{-1} on O*). The \"conductor matching\" fails.\n\n(B) The det-character det(pi) = omega_pi^n. Same issue as (A).\n\n(C) Some character extracted from the K-type theory of pi. Not standard and never defined.\n\nFor GL_n (n \u003e= 2), the analog of the GL_1 Gauss sum nonvanishing is the nonvanishing of the Godement-Jacquet epsilon factor epsilon(s, pi, psi). But epsilon(s, pi, psi) is ALWAYS a nonzero constant times a power of q^{-s}, regardless of conductor matching. The \"conductor matching\" argument is specific to the GL_1 situation and does not generalize as the node implies.\n\nThe node commits a type error by treating an n^2-dimensional representation as if it were a one-dimensional character, then applying a GL_1 result (conductor-matched Gauss sum nonvanishing) to a categorically different mathematical object.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
