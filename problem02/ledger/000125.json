Write I(s) = P(q^{-s}) where P(z) = sum_{k=a}^{b} c_k z^k is a Laurent polynomial in z = q^{-s}. The claim 'I(s) has no zeros' means P(z) != 0 for ALL z in C*. But the argument only shows P(q^{-1/2}) != 0, i.e., P is nonzero at the SINGLE POINT z = q^{-1/2}.\n\nEXPLICIT COUNTEREXAMPLE: Let P(z) = 1 + z. This is a Laurent polynomial (with a = 0, b = 1). We have P(q^{-1/2}) = 1 + q^{-1/2} != 0 for any q. But P(-1) = 0, so P has a zero on C*. The corresponding I(s) = 1 + q^{-s} would satisfy I(1/2) != 0 but I(s_0) = 0 where q^{-s_0} = -1 (namely s_0 = i*pi/log(q)). So I(s) is nonzero at s = 1/2 but has a zero at s = i*pi/log(q). The function I(s) is NOT a monomial despite being nonzero at one point.\n\nMore generally, any polynomial P(z) of degree \u003e= 1 has zeros on C* (by the fundamental theorem of algebra). So a Laurent polynomial is a monomial if and only if it has exactly one nonzero coefficient. Verifying P at one point cannot distinguish a one-term polynomial from a multi-term one.\n\nThe correct approach to showing a Laurent polynomial is a monomial would be one of:\n(a) Show it has exactly one nonzero term by direct computation.\n(b) Identify it with a known monomial (e.g., the epsilon factor, which is what Step 3 attempts).\n(c) Show it satisfies a functional equation whose solution space consists only of monomials.\n\nStep 4 uses none of these approaches. The argument as stated is logically invalid — it confuses 'nonvanishing at one point' with 'nonvanishing everywhere.' This is not a subtle gap but a fundamental error in reasoning.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
