It does not apply to V_mod, since V_mod is a different test vector with different properties.\n\n(2) The alternative V_mod from Node 1.4.4.2 is introduced as a fallback 'for cases where the identity in (C) has not been fully verified in the literature.' But Node 1.4.4.2 defers the actual construction and nonvanishing verification of V_mod to a child node that DOES NOT EXIST. There is no child node of 1.4.4.2 in the proof tree.\n\n(3) A QED node must make a DEFINITE choice. Either V = V^circ works (via the epsilon factor identification), or V = V_mod works (via compact support collapse). The node cannot hedge between two incompatible strategies. If the epsilon factor route (V^circ) is the primary argument, V_mod should be removed from Case 3 of the QED. If V_mod is the fallback, the construction must actually be completed somewhere in the tree.\n\nThis ambiguity does not introduce a mathematical error per se, but it leaves the proof incomplete: neither strategy is fully established, and the QED node does not commit to one.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
