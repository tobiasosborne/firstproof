The additive twist psi^{-1}(Q a_n k_{nn}) from Node 1.1, combined with K_1(q)-invariance of V^circ, produces a K-integral that is a generalized Gauss sum. Conductor-level analysis shows: (a) when val(Q varpi^{m_n}) \u003e 0, the twist is trivial and the K-integral vanishes by orthogonality for ramified pi; (b) when val(Q varpi^{m_n}) \u003c -c(pi), oscillation is too rapid and the K-integral vanishes by cancellation; (c) when val(Q varpi^{m_n}) = -c(pi), the conductors match and the K-integral equals a nonzero Gauss sum. Only case (c) contributes, so the torus sum collapses to a single coset, yielding a monomial.","new_statement":"Iwasawa Unfolding and Conductor Analysis (Ramified Case, c(pi) \u003e= 1): This node handles the core computation for ramified pi, using W = W^circ (Node 1.3) and V = V^circ. By the commutation identity (Node 1.1), the integral becomes I(s) = int_{N_n \\ GL_n(F)} W^circ(diag(g,1)) psi^{-1}(Q g_{nn}) V^circ(g) |det g|^{s-1/2} dg. Applying Iwasawa decomposition g = nak with a = diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_n}), k in K_n = GL_n(o), and the Haar measure decomposition dg = delta_B^{-1}(a) da dk, the integral unfolds to: I(s) = sum_{m in Z^n} delta_B^{-1}(a) |det a|^{s-1/2} J(m), where J(m) = int_{K_n} W^circ(diag(ak,1)) psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} k_{nn}) V^circ(ak) dk is the K-integral.\n\nSTEP 1 (W^circ factorization): For any k in K_n = GL_n(o), the block-diagonal element diag(k,1) in GL_{n+1}(F) has last row (0,...,0,1), which satisfies the K_1(p^c) congruence condition for any c \u003e= 0. Therefore diag(k,1) in K_1(p^{c(Pi)}), and W^circ(diag(ak,1)) = W^circ(diag(a,1)) for all k in K_n. Hence W^circ factors out: J(m) = W^circ(diag(a,1)) * J_K(m), where J_K(m) = int_{K_n} psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} k_{nn}) V^circ(ak) dk is the reduced K-integral (an integral over GL_n(o) with an additive twist in k_{nn} and V^circ depending on all entries of k; this is NOT a classical Gauss sum for n \u003e= 2, but a matrix-coefficient integral with partial additive twist).\n\nSTEP 2 (K_1(q)-invariance): Since V^circ is right-K_1(q)-invariant and the additive twist psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} k_{nn}) is also right-K_1(q)-invariant (because for k' in K_1(q), (kk')_{nn} = k_{nn} + O(q) and val(Q varpi^{m_n}) * val(q-terms) \u003e= 0 when m_n \u003e= 0), the integrand factors through K_n / K_1(q) = GL_n(o/q). For m_n \u003c 0, we use that V^circ(ak) = 0 when the torus element a is sufficiently far from the support of V^circ.\n\nSTEP 3 (Conductor analysis on m_n): The additive character x -\u003e psi(Q varpi^{m_n} x) restricted to o has conductor p^{c(pi)-m_n}. Three regimes:\n(a) m_n \u003e c(pi): The twist is trivial on o. Then J_K(m) = int_{K_n} V^circ(ak) dk = [P_K V^circ](a), the projection of V^circ onto K_n-fixed vectors. Since c(pi) \u003e= 1, the space pi^{K_n} = 0 (by definition of conductor: c(pi) \u003e= 1 means pi has no nonzero K_n-fixed vectors). Therefore J_K(m) = 0 for all a.\n(b) m_n \u003c 0: The twist psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} k_{nn}) has conductor p^{c(pi)-m_n} strictly containing o, so it oscillates on o at a level finer than the K_1(q)-invariance of V^circ. By fiber decomposition over k_{nn} mod p^{c(pi)-m_n} and orthogonality of additive characters, J_K(m) = 0.\n(c) 0 \u003c= m_n \u003c= c(pi): The twist has conductor p^{c(pi)-m_n} contained in o. The K-integral J_K(m) is a finite sum over GL_n(o/q) weighted by the additive twist. By the fiber decomposition (Node 1.4.4), this reduces to a sum over (o/q)^x in the k_{nn}-variable. Nonvanishing requires the conductor of the twist restricted to 1+p^j to match the K_1(q)-level of V^circ, which forces m_n = 0 (detailed in Node 1.4.3).\n\nSTEP 4 (Remaining torus sum with m_n = 0): Setting m_n = 0, the integral reduces to I(s) = sum_{m_1,...,m_{n-1}} W^circ(diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_{n-1}},1,1)) delta_B^{-1}(a_0) |det a_0|^{s-1/2} J_K(m_1,...,m_{n-1},0), where a_0 = diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_{n-1}},1). The conductor analysis does NOT constrain m_1,...,m_{n-1}. These coordinates are constrained by the torus support of W^circ (on GL_{n+1}) and V^circ (on GL_n) via the Matringe (2013) support formulas. The analysis splits by representation type of pi and is completed in child nodes (Nodes 1.4.3-1.4.5).\n\nDEPENDENCIES: Node 1.1 (commutation identity), Node 1.3 (test vector choices W = W^circ, V = V^circ for ramified pi).","owner":"prover-1-4"}
