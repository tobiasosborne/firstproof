This is FALSE for m_n \u003c 0.\n\nPROOF THAT THE TWIST IS NOT K_1(q)-INVARIANT WHEN m_n \u003c 0:\n\nFor k' in K_1(q), we have (kk')_{nn} = k_{nn} + epsilon, where epsilon = sum_j k_{nj}(k'_{jn} - delta_{jn}). Since k' in K_1(q), we have k'_{jn} - delta_{jn} in p^c for all j, so epsilon in p^c. The twist changes by:\n\npsi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} (kk')_{nn}) / psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} k_{nn}) = psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} epsilon).\n\nFor K_1(q)-invariance we need Q varpi^{m_n} epsilon in ker(psi) = o for all epsilon in p^c. But val(Q varpi^{m_n} p^c) = (-c) + m_n + c = m_n. When m_n \u003c 0, the product Q varpi^{m_n} epsilon can have NEGATIVE valuation, so psi is nontrivial. Therefore the twist is NOT K_1(q)-invariant for m_n \u003c 0.\n\nCONSEQUENCE: The Fourier transform over o/q is ill-defined. The character x -\u003e psi(Q varpi^{m_n} x) is NOT well-defined on o/q = o/p^c when m_n \u003c 0, because psi(Q varpi^{m_n} (x + p^c)) != psi(Q varpi^{m_n} x) (the character is not constant on cosets of p^c). The entire finite sum representation 'J_K(m) proportional to sum_{x in o/q} psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} x) Phi(a,x)' is MEANINGLESS for m_n \u003c 0, and the 'orthogonality' conclusion has no valid premise.\n\nCORRECT APPROACH (sketch): For m_n \u003c 0, one should NOT reduce to o/q. Instead, use the V^circ-invariance to factor the K_n-integral as an outer sum over K_n/K_1(q) times an inner integral over K_1(q):\n\nJ_K(m) = sum_{k-bar in GL_n(o/q)} V^circ(a lift(k-bar)) int_{K_1(q)} psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} (k-bar h)_{nn}) dh.\n\nThe inner integral: (k-bar h)_{nn} = k-bar_{nn} + epsilon(k-bar, h) with epsilon in p^c, so the inner integral equals psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} k-bar_{nn}) times int_{K_1(q)} psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} epsilon(k-bar,h)) dh. The map h -\u003e epsilon(k-bar, h) surjects onto p^c (since the last row of k-bar is unimodular in GL_n(o)), and psi^{-1}(Q varpi^{m_n} -) is nontrivial on p^c when m_n \u003c 0 (as shown above). By orthogonality of characters on the compact group, this inner integral vanishes for EVERY k-bar.\n\nThe conclusion J_K(m) = 0 for m_n \u003c 0 is almost certainly correct, but via this completely different mechanism (inner integral over K_1(q) vanishes), NOT via the stated Fourier transform over o/q.\n\nNOTE: The parent node 1.4 STEP 2 explicitly acknowledges this issue: 'For m_n \u003c 0, we use that V^circ(ak) = 0 when the torus element a is sufficiently far from the support of V^circ.' This is yet a THIRD argument (support-based), different from both the invalid Fourier argument in 1.4.3 and the correct K_1(q)-averaging argument sketched above. The proliferation of incompatible arguments for the same case is a sign that none has been carefully verified.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
