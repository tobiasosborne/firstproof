The node states: \"Let K(pi, psi) denote the Kirillov model of pi, realized as a space of locally constant functions on F^x.\" This is correct ONLY for n=1 (where the Kirillov model of a GL_1 representation acts on functions on F^0\\{0} -- which is trivial -- or more accurately, for GL_2 the Kirillov model is on F^x). But the node is describing the case n \u003e= 1 generally in the same paragraph.\n\nFor general GL_n with n \u003e= 2, the Kirillov model K(pi, psi) is realized on the space of locally constant functions on F^{n-1}\\{0} (functions on the last column of the mirabolic subgroup P_n, minus the origin). The node later (in the parenthetical about general n) mentions \"Whittaker function whose Kirillov restriction has support contained in a compact subset of F^{n-1}\\{0}\" which is correct for general n, but the initial description \"locally constant functions on F^x\" is only correct for n=1 (or more precisely, for pi on GL_2 using the GL_2 Kirillov model).\n\nThis creates confusion: the Schwartz space S(F^x) is defined in the F^x context, and phi_0 = char(o^x) is defined as a function on F^x. For n \u003e= 2, the correct objects are S(F^{n-1}\\{0}) and phi_0 = char((o^x)^{n-1}), as the children 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 use. The parent node should clearly state the dimension of the Kirillov model domain depends on n, and specify: for n=1 (GL_2 representation), K(pi, psi) is on F^x; for general GL_n, K(pi, psi) is on F^{n-1}\\{0}.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
