However, the node should explicitly note that the s-independence follows from a_0 = I_n (both delta_B and |det|^{s-1/2} are trivial at the identity), rather than simply dropping these factors without comment. The s-independence is a non-trivial conclusion that deserves explicit justification.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
