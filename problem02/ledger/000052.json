Specifically, in the Iwasawa decomposition g = nak with a = diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_n}), the Kirillov restriction of V_0 is supported on {a : m_1 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_{n-1} \u003e= 0 and m_{n-1} = 0}, which means m_i \u003e= 0 for all i and m_{n-1} = 0. Combined with support from phi_0, the torus support is finite once |det a|^{s-1/2} contributes the s-dependence, because the Casselman-Shalika support constraint from W^circ on the GL_{n+1}-side bounds m_1,...,m_{n-2} from above.\n(P2) V_0 is right-K_0(p)-invariant (invariant under the Iwahori-level subgroup), which is a weaker invariance than V^circ (which is K-fixed), but sufficient for the Iwasawa integral computation.\n\nThe proof that the RS integral with W = W^circ and V = V_0 is a nonzero monomial for unramified pi is given in Node 1.3.2.","new_statement":"Unramified Test Vector Construction (c(pi) = 0, general n): Let pi be an unramified generic representation of GL_n(F), so pi is an unramified principal series pi = Ind_B^{GL_n}(chi_1 x ... x chi_n) with each chi_i unramified. The Kirillov model K(pi, psi) is realized on a space of locally constant functions on F^{n-1} \\ {0}. By Bernstein-Zelevinsky (Theorem 5.21 of Bernstein-Zelevinsky 1976), the Schwartz space S(F^{n-1} \\ {0}) embeds into K(pi, psi) for any generic pi.\n\nDefine phi_0 = char((o^x)^{n-1}), the characteristic function of (o^x)^{n-1} in F^{n-1}. This set is compact-open in F^{n-1} \\ {0} (since o^x is compact-open in F^x, and the product (o^x)^{n-1} is disjoint from {0}). Hence phi_0 in S(F^{n-1} \\ {0}) subset K(pi, psi). Let V_0 in W(pi, psi) be the Whittaker function corresponding to phi_0 under the canonical isomorphism W(pi, psi) ~ K(pi, psi).\n\nKey properties of V_0:\n(P1) TORUS SUPPORT COLLAPSE: In the Iwasawa decomposition g = nak with a = diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_n}) and k in K_n, the Kirillov coordinates of ak at the identity coset of the mirabolic are (varpi^{m_1} k_{1n},..., varpi^{m_{n-1}} k_{n-1,n}). For V_0(ak) to be nonzero, each coordinate varpi^{m_i} k_{in} must lie in o^x. Since k in GL_n(o) we have k_{in} in o, but for varpi^{m_i} k_{in} in o^x we need val(varpi^{m_i} k_{in}) = 0, i.e., m_i + val(k_{in}) = 0. Since val(k_{in}) \u003e= 0, this requires m_i \u003c= 0. But the standard Iwasawa-torus support for Whittaker functions of generic representations constrains m_i (via the dominance condition on the GL_{n+1}-side from W^circ): the Casselman-Shalika formula gives W^circ(diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_n},1)) = 0 unless m_1 \u003e= m_2 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_n \u003e= 0. Combined with m_i \u003c= 0 from the V_0-support, this forces m_i = 0 for ALL i = 1,...,n. Therefore the torus sum collapses to the single point a = I_n (i.e., m_1 = ... = m_n = 0).\n\n(P2) MEMBERSHIP: phi_0 in S(F^{n-1} \\ {0}) because (o^x)^{n-1} is a compact-open subset of F^{n-1} that does not contain 0 (every coordinate is a unit). By the Bernstein-Zelevinsky embedding, phi_0 in K(pi, psi) and thus V_0 in W(pi, psi).\n\n(P3) NONVANISHING OF K-INTEGRAL AT a = I_n: At a = I_n, the K-integral J(I_n) = int_{K_n} V_0(k) dk = int_{K_n} phi_0(k_{1n},...,k_{n-1,n}) dk. This equals the measure of {k in K_n : (k_{1n},...,k_{n-1,n}) in (o^x)^{n-1}}, which is positive because the set {k in GL_n(o) : all k_{in} in o^x for i \u003c n} is a nonempty open subset of K_n of positive Haar measure.\n\nThe proof that these properties yield a nonzero monomial integral is completed in Node 1.3.2.","owner":"prover-1-3"}
