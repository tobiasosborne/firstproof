Without this identity, the entire Iwasawa unfolding has no additive twist to analyze.\n\n(2) Node 1.3 (Choice of Test Vectors): The statement says 'K_1(q)-invariance of V^circ' — this uses V = V^circ, the test vector choice from Node 1.3. The conductor analysis in all three cases (a)-(c) depends on V being the new vector with specific K_1(q)-invariance properties.\n\nBoth dependencies must be declared. Furthermore, the inference type is listed as 'assumption' but should be a derivation or computation, since Node 1.4 is not postulating a hypothesis — it is performing a computation using prior results.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
