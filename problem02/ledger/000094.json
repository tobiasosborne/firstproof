The entire torus collapse argument — steps (i), (ii), and (iv) — rests on the claim that V_0(ak) can be computed by evaluating phi_0 at the 'Kirillov coordinates' (varpi^{m_1} k_{1n}, ..., varpi^{m_{n-1}} k_{n-1,n}) of ak. This identification is only valid when ak lies in the mirabolic subgroup P_n = {g in GL_n : last row is (0,...,0,1)}.\n\nFor general k in K_n = GL_n(o), the element ak is NOT in P_n. The last row of ak is (varpi^{m_n} k_{n1}, ..., varpi^{m_n} k_{nn}), which equals (0,...,0,1) only when m_n = 0, k_{nj} = 0 for j \u003c n, and k_{nn} = 1 — a measure-zero subset of K_n. For a positive-measure subset of K_n (by Bruhat decomposition, the big Bruhat cell has elements not in P_n), evaluation of V_0(ak) requires the FULL representation action pi(k) on the Kirillov model, involving nontrivial intertwining operators.\n\nConcrete counterexample for n=2 (GL_3 x GL_2): Take k = w = ((0,1),(-1,0)) in GL_2(o). This k is NOT in P_2. The action pi(w) on phi_0 = char(o^x) in the Kirillov model involves the local functional equation / Bessel transform, giving (pi(w) phi_0)(a) depending non-trivially on the representation pi. So V_0(w) = (pi(w) phi_0)(1) != phi_0(w_{12}) = phi_0(1) = 1 in general.\n\nThis invalidates: (a) Step (i): 'V_0(ak) = 0 unless Kirillov coordinates lie in support of phi_0' — FALSE for k outside P_n. (b) Step (ii): 'J(a) = 0 unless m_n = 0' — NOT ESTABLISHED without controlling V_0(ak) for all k in K_n. (c) The torus collapse 'all m_i = 0' — depends on this flawed identification. (d) The final K-integral computation int_{K_n} V_0(k) dk = vol({k : (k_{1n},...,k_{n-1,n}) in (o^x)^{n-1}}) — same error at a = I_n.\n\nThis is the same fundamental error as ch-fc31ed059f008e23 on Node 1.3.1, but Node 1.3.2 independently commits it in its own argument.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
