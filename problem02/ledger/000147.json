The root node statement omits this conductor specification, saying only that psi exists implicitly via W(Pi, psi^{-1}) and W(pi, psi). This matters because:\n\n(1) The definition of u_Q depends on Q being a generator of q^{-1} where q is the conductor of pi, and the conductor analysis in nodes 1.4 and 1.5 explicitly uses that psi has conductor o (e.g., psi is trivial on o and nontrivial on p^{-1}).\n\n(2) While the truth of the conjecture is independent of the conductor of psi (one can always renormalize), the specific construction of u_Q and the proof strategy depend on psi having conductor o. The children (nodes 1.4.2, 1.4.3, 1.5.1) all implicitly assume this normalization.\n\n(3) For mathematical precision, the root node should state: 'Let psi : F -\u003e C* be a nontrivial additive character of conductor o' to match problem.md and to ensure the children's conductor computations are well-founded.\n\nThis is minor because the conjecture's truth is not affected (it holds for any nontrivial psi), but the proof as written requires the specific normalization cond(psi) = o, which should be stated at the root level.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
