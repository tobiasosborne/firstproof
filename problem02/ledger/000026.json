When c(pi) = 0: (1) the conductor ideal is q = o, so Q generates o, meaning Q is a unit; (2) V^circ is the spherical (K-fixed) Whittaker function; (3) the twist psi^{-1}(Q g_{nn}) from Node 1.1 is trivial on the support of V^circ (Casselman-Shalika gives support in m_n \u003e= 0, and for m_n \u003e= 0 with Q a unit, the argument lies in o where psi is trivial); (4) the integral therefore equals the standard untwisted RS integral with new vectors, which by JPSS/Matringe theory equals L(s, Pi x pi); (5) for non-supercuspidal Pi (e.g., principal series), L(s, Pi x pi) = product of 1/(1 - alpha_i beta_j q^{-s}) which has poles, hence is NOT a monomial and NOT finite-and-nonzero for all s. Also, Node 1.4 case (a) vanishing ('orthogonality for ramified pi') explicitly requires pi ramified; for unramified pi, V^circ is K-fixed, so the K-integral at case (a) levels gives V^circ(a) vol(K) \\!= 0, producing multiple contributing torus cosets instead of a single one. The HANDOFF.md itself flags this under 'Unramified Case -- Special Handling' and prescribes V \\!= V^circ for unramified pi. The universal claim V = V^circ must be replaced by a case split.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
