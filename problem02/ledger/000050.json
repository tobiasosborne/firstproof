{"type":"node_created","timestamp":"2026-02-09T13:00:59.779566197Z","node":{"id":"1.3.2","type":"claim","statement":"Monomial Property for Unramified pi (c(pi) = 0): When pi is unramified and V = V_0 (from Node 1.3.1), the Rankin-Selberg integral with W = W^circ equals a nonzero monomial. Here is the argument.\n\nSince c(pi) = 0, the conductor ideal is q = o, so Q is a unit in o^x, and u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1} lies in GL_{n+1}(o) = K_{n+1}.\n\nBy the commutation identity (Node 1.1), the integral becomes:\n  I(s) = int_{N_n \\ GL_n(F)} W^circ(diag(g,1)) psi^{-1}(Q g_{nn}) V_0(g) |det g|^{s-1/2} dg.\n\nApplying the Iwasawa decomposition g = nak with a = diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_n}), k in K_n = GL_n(o), and using that W^circ(diag(ak,1)) = W^circ(diag(a,1)) (since diag(k,1) in K_{n+1} subset K_1(p^{c(Pi)}) acts trivially on W^circ), the integral becomes:\n  I(s) = sum_{m_1,...,m_n in Z} W^circ(diag(a,1)) delta_B^{-1}(a) |det a|^{s-1/2} J(a)\n\nwhere J(a) = int_{K_n} psi^{-1}(Q a_n k_{nn}) V_0(ak) dk is the K-integral.\n\nNow we use the Kirillov-model support of V_0. The function V_0 corresponds to phi_0 = char(o^{n-1} \\ p o^{n-1}) in the Kirillov model. The key consequence is:\n(i) V_0(ak) = 0 unless the Kirillov coordinates of ak lie in o^{n-1} \\ p o^{n-1}. For the torus element a = diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_n}), this forces m_n = 0 (the last coordinate is a unit) and constrains m_1,...,m_{n-1} to a FINITE set determined by the support of phi_0.\n(ii) More precisely, V_0(ak) depends on k but the support constraint gives: J(a) = 0 unless m_n = 0.\n(iii) When m_n = 0, and since Q is a unit, the twist psi^{-1}(Q a_n k_{nn}) = psi^{-1}(Q k_{nn}) for k in K_n. Since k_{nn} in o^x (as k in GL_n(o)) and Q in o^x, we have Q k_{nn} in o^x subset o, and psi is trivial on o, so psi^{-1}(Q k_{nn}) = 1. The twist disappears entirely.\n(iv) With the twist gone and m_n = 0, the K-integral simplifies to J(a) = int_{K_n} V_0(ak) dk.\n\nFor the n = 1 case: m_1 = m_n = 0 is forced, the sum is a single term, giving I(s) = W^circ(I_2) * vol(o^x) != 0, a constant monomial.\n\nFor general n \u003e= 2 with m_n = 0: The sum is over m_1,...,m_{n-1}. By the compact support of phi_0 in the Kirillov model, V_0(ak) = 0 unless (varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_{n-1}}) lies in the support of phi_0, which forces all m_i \u003e= 0. Moreover, the Casselman-Shalika formula for W^circ on the GL_{n+1}-side gives W^circ(diag(varpi^{m_1},...,varpi^{m_{n-1}},1,1)) = 0 unless (m_1,...,m_{n-1},0) satisfies the dominance condition m_1 \u003e= m_2 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_{n-1} \u003e= 0. On this finite set, the sum sum_{m_1 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_{n-1} \u003e= 0} W^circ(diag(a,1)) delta_B^{-1}(a) |det a|^{s-1/2} J(a) is a FINITE sum of terms each of the form c_m q^{-k(m) s} with distinct exponents k(m) = sum_i m_i (up to a constant shift from delta_B^{-1}). This sum is a Laurent polynomial in q^{-s}, which is a monomial if and only if exactly one term contributes.\n\nTo ensure exactly one term: Note that phi_0 = char(o^{n-1} \\ p o^{n-1}) requires at least one coordinate to be a unit, so m_{n-1} = 0. The tightest constraint comes from combining: m_{n-1} = 0 (from phi_0 support) and the Kirillov-model support giving that the restriction to the last row of the mirabolic forces the last Kirillov coordinate in o^x, i.e., m_{n-1} = 0. The remaining coordinates m_1 \u003e= ... \u003e= m_{n-2} \u003e= 0 may still produce multiple terms for n \u003e= 3. However, we can REFINE the choice of phi_0: instead of char(o^{n-1} \\ p o^{n-1}), take phi_0 = char((o^x)^{n-1}), the characteristic function of (o^x)^{n-1} in F^{n-1}. This forces ALL m_i = 0 for i = 1,...,n-1. With this choice, the torus sum collapses to the single term m_1 = ... = m_{n-1} = m_n = 0, giving:\n  I(s) = W^circ(I_{n+1}) * int_{K_n} V_0(k) dk = W^circ(I_{n+1}) * vol((o^x)^{n-1} in appropriate measure) != 0,\nwhich is a nonzero constant (monomial with k = 0), using W^circ(I_{n+1}) != 0 from Matringe-Miyauchi and the fact that int_{K_n} V_0(k) dk = vol \u003e 0 since V_0 restricted to K_n via Kirillov coordinates gives char((o^x)^{n-1}) evaluated at (k_{1,n},...,k_{n-1,n}) which integrates to a positive volume.\n\nAMENDED DEFINITION: In Node 1.3.1, replace phi_0 = char(o^{n-1} \\ p o^{n-1}) by phi_0 = char((o^x)^{n-1}), the characteristic function of (o^x)^{n-1} in F^{n-1} \\ {0}. This function lies in S(F^{n-1} \\ {0}) since (o^x)^{n-1} is compact-open in F^{n-1} \\ {0}, hence phi_0 in K(pi, psi) by the Bernstein-Zelevinsky embedding.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"ad95d8512b22eb6087eac9f2bb6a16d1a58b61517910721ce822d3f030d1b942","created":"2026-02-09T13:00:59.779542954Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
