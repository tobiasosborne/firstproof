# Problem 7: Lattices with 2-Torsion and Rationally Acyclic Universal Covers

**Field:** Geometric Topology / Lattices in Lie Groups

**Author:** Shmuel Weinberger (University of Chicago)

## Setup

Suppose that **Γ** is a **uniform lattice** in a real semi-simple group.

Suppose that **Γ contains some 2-torsion** (i.e., Γ has an element of order 2).

## Question

Is it possible for Γ to be the **fundamental group** of a compact manifold without boundary whose **universal cover is acyclic over the rational numbers ℚ**?

## Key Concepts

- **Uniform lattice Γ**: A discrete subgroup Γ of a Lie group G such that the quotient G/Γ is compact.
- **Real semi-simple group**: A connected real Lie group whose Lie algebra is semi-simple (i.e., has no nonzero solvable ideals). Examples include SL_n(ℝ), SO(p,q), Sp(2n,ℝ).
- **2-torsion**: An element γ ∈ Γ with γ² = e (the identity), γ ≠ e.
- **Fundamental group π₁(M)**: The group of homotopy classes of loops in a manifold M based at a point.
- **Compact manifold without boundary**: A closed, compact topological manifold.
- **Universal cover**: The simply connected covering space of M.
- **Acyclic over ℚ**: A space X is acyclic over ℚ if H_k(X; ℚ) = 0 for all k > 0 and H₀(X; ℚ) ≅ ℚ. Equivalently, X has the rational homology of a point.

## Constraints

The proof should be roughly five pages or fewer.
