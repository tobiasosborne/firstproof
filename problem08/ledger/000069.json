The problem statement allows non-compact polyhedral Lagrangian surfaces K (the definition says 'finite polyhedral complex' but this means finitely many face types, not finitely many cells — a non-compact K can have infinitely many cells of the same types). The node's assembly procedure has several issues for non-compact K:\n\n(1) INFINITELY MANY VERTEX SMOOTHINGS: Phase A applies vertex smoothing 'simultaneously' at all vertices. If there are infinitely many vertices, the sum H = sum_{v} H_v of Hamiltonians is an infinite sum. For this to be well-defined as a smooth function on R^4, the supports must be locally finite (only finitely many H_v are nonzero near any compact set). This follows from the local finiteness of the polyhedral cell structure, but needs to be stated.\n\n(2) COMPLETENESS OF THE HAMILTONIAN FLOW: Even if H = sum H_v is well-defined as a smooth function, the Hamiltonian vector field X_H must be COMPLETE (i.e., its flow exists for all time). For compactly supported H, completeness is automatic. For non-compactly supported H (infinite sum extending to infinity), completeness requires uniform bounds on the Hamiltonian vector field, which in turn requires uniform bounds on the H_v. If the vertex geometry degenerates (dihedral angles approaching 0 or pi at vertices going to infinity), the smoothing Hamiltonians may grow without bound.\n\n(3) CONVERGENCE TO IDENTITY: Node 1.7 requires the Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms Phi_t to converge to the identity as t-\u003e0. For non-compact K with infinitely many smoothings, this requires UNIFORM convergence on compact sets, which is not addressed.\n\n(4) ACTUALLY 'FINITE POLYHEDRAL COMPLEX': Re-reading the problem statement, it says 'a FINITE polyhedral complex all of whose faces are Lagrangians, and which is a topological submanifold of R^4.' The word 'finite' means finitely many cells. A finite polyhedral complex is automatically compact (it has finitely many cells, each compact). So a 'finite polyhedral complex' that is a topological submanifold is a COMPACT surface. The non-compact case may be irrelevant! But if so, the node should explicitly acknowledge this, since the HANDOFF discusses non-compact K extensively (planes, cylinders, etc.). Either: (a) the problem only applies to compact K, in which case the node should state this and all non-compact concerns are moot, or (b) 'finite' has a different meaning (finitely many face types), in which case the non-compact issues stand.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
