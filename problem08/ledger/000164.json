The graph of dF_0 is a smooth Lagrangian plane. (2) OUTER ZONE (epsilon \u003c |X| \u003c delta): Use a RADIAL partition of unity to transition from F_0 to F_PL, going through the angular interpolation in an annular region where the origin is excluded and smoothness is not an issue. Specifically, define F_mid(X) = chi(|X|/epsilon)*F_angular(X) + (1-chi(|X|/epsilon))*F_0(X) where F_angular is the angular interpolation (smooth away from 0). This two-zone approach avoids the origin completely while still smoothing the vertex.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
