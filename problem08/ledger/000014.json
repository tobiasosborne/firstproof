Since (R^4, omega_std) is exact symplectic with primitive lambda = (1/2)(x_1 dy_1 - y_1 dx_1 + x_2 dy_2 - y_2 dx_2) and H^1(R^4;R)=0, the flux class of any compactly supported Lagrangian isotopy vanishes identically (Banyaga). Each local smoothing is generated by a compactly supported Hamiltonian, and the finite composition of such Hamiltonians (vertex surgeries, then edge roundings) is itself Hamiltonian.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"008410a772129c63a6f995d7f567baa2ab5a6fb9e6108e74630ee2e107f45a6d","created":"2026-02-10T21:15:47.966157872Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
