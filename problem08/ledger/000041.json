(2) Node 1.3 (vertex smoothing), because after Phase A of node 1.5, the edges terminate at already-smoothed vertex regions, and the edge smoothing boundary conditions depend on the output of node 1.3. At minimum, node 1.4 should depend on node 1.2 for the classification of edge types (2 Lagrangian faces meeting along each edge). Additionally, node 1.5 (global assembly) depends on 1.4, but this is a forward dependency that 1.5 should declare rather than 1.4.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
