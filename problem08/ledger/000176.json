Step 6 defines the total isotopy as: phi_t^{total} = phi_{2t}^{H_A} for t in [0,1/2] and phi_t^{total} = phi_{2t-1}^{H_B} o phi_1^{H_A} for t in [1/2,1]. At t=1/2, the left formula gives phi_1^{H_A} and the right gives phi_0^{H_B} o phi_1^{H_A} = id o phi_1^{H_A} = phi_1^{H_A}, so the isotopy is continuous. But for the concatenation to be a SMOOTH Hamiltonian isotopy, the time-dependent Hamiltonian generating it must be smooth in t. The concatenated Hamiltonian is H(t) = 2*H_A for t in [0,1/2] and H(t) = 2*H_B for t in [1/2,1]. At t=1/2, this jumps from 2*H_A to 2*H_B (unless H_A = H_B, which they are not in general). A discontinuous Hamiltonian does NOT generate a smooth isotopy. The fix is standard: use time reparametrization with flat transition. Let rho(t) be a smooth function with rho(t)=0 for t\u003c=1/4, rho(t)=1 for t\u003e=3/4, rho'\u003e=0. Then H(t) = rho'(t)*H_A for Phase A and (1-rho)'(t)*H_B for Phase B, suitably reparametrized so each phase uses its full time allocation. But the node does not invoke this standard fix and instead presents a piecewise-linear time reparametrization that gives a non-smooth Hamiltonian at t=1/2.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
