For a 4-valent vertex with faces F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4 (cyclically ordered), there are 3 possible splittings into two 3-valent vertices: (a) {F_1,F_2,F_new}|{F_3,F_4,F_new}, (b) {F_1,F_3,F_new}|{F_2,F_4,F_new}, (c) {F_1,F_4,F_new}|{F_2,F_3,F_new}, where F_new is the new face along the connecting edge. The node does not address: (1) Whether all 3 splittings produce valid Lagrangian smoothings (the new face F_new must be a Lagrangian plane, constraining the splitting direction). (2) Whether different splittings yield different smooth Lagrangians (topologically or symplectically). (3) Whether a consistent global choice of splitting can be made across all vertices. (4) Whether the cyclic ordering of faces at each vertex restricts the possible splittings (splitting {F_1,F_3}|{F_2,F_4} separates cyclically adjacent faces). Agent 1 explicitly identified this non-uniqueness as a pitfall. The proof must either show all choices work or specify which choice is made and why it exists.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
