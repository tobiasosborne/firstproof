Step 8(b) argues: K is embedded, phi_1^{H_A} is a diffeomorphism, therefore K_A = phi_1^{H_A}(K) is 'an embedded submanifold (diffeomorphic to K).' The term 'embedded submanifold' requires smooth regularity. A diffeomorphism of the ambient space preserves smooth embedded submanifolds. K is a TOPOLOGICAL submanifold — embedded in the topological sense but not a smooth submanifold at vertices/edges. The image K_A = phi_1^{H_A}(K) is a TOPOLOGICAL embedded submanifold (homeomorphic image of embedded surface under homeomorphism), but calling it 'an embedded submanifold' in the smooth sense is incorrect. The correct argument for embeddedness of L is: (1) L is smooth (by Step 7). (2) L is injectively immersed (because it is the image of K, a topological submanifold without self-intersections, under the injective map phi_1^{H_B} circ phi_1^{H_A}). (3) L is proper (K is compact hence closed; continuous image of compact set is compact hence closed in R^4). (4) Therefore L is a smooth embedded submanifold. The current argument skips the crucial fact that smooth embeddedness requires FIRST establishing smoothness (Step 7) and THEN showing no self-intersections, rather than claiming a diffeomorphism sends 'embedded submanifolds' to 'embedded submanifolds' when the initial surface is not smooth.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
