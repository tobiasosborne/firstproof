For Type A, the 4 planes determine a point in the configuration space Conf_4(LG(2,4)), and the claim should explain what structure this configuration space has and how it relates to the Sp(4)-orbits. The topology of LG(2,4) itself (a non-trivial S^2 bundle over S^1, with pi_1 = Z) is correctly described by the identification U(2)/O(2) but is never used in the argument.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
