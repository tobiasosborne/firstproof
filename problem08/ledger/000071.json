The node claims 'each vertex singularity admits a local Lagrangian smoothing supported in an arbitrarily small ball B_delta(v).' For the tropical resolution, this claim faces several problems: (1) THE SPLITTING CREATES NEW SINGULARITIES: Splitting a 4-valent vertex into two 3-valent vertices introduces a NEW EDGE between the two 3-valent vertices. This edge is itself a singularity (two faces meeting along a line). So the 'vertex smoothing' does NOT produce a smooth Lagrangian in B_delta(v) — it produces a piecewise-linear Lagrangian with two 3-valent vertex singularities and one edge singularity inside B_delta(v). These must then be separately smoothed. (2) THE TWO-STEP PROCESS: First resolve 4-valent to two 3-valent (introducing an edge), then smooth each 3-valent vertex using pair-of-pants, then smooth the connecting edge. This multi-step process is not described, and the interaction between vertex and edge smoothings in the small ball is not analyzed. (3) ARBITRARILY SMALL SUPPORT: The Matessi-Mikhalkin construction involves a specific scale (the 'neck size'). Can this scale be made arbitrarily small relative to delta? The construction in (C*)^2 uses a torus fibration whose fibers have a fixed size. Scaling down to fit in B_delta(v) requires careful analysis. (4) MATCHING BOUNDARY CONDITIONS: The smoothed Lagrangian inside B_delta(v) must agree with the original polyhedral Lagrangian on the boundary of B_delta(v). The tropical resolution changes the combinatorial structure (4-valent becomes two 3-valent), so the boundary of the smoothing region must be analyzed carefully.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
