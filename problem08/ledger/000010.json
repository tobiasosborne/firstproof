The link of v in S^3 is a simple closed curve composed of 4 great circle arcs. The configuration is classified into: Type A (generic) where the 4 half-planes lie in 4 distinct Lagrangian planes with non-consecutive pairs transverse, or Type B (crossing) where opposite half-planes are coplanar, forming two transverse Lagrangian planes. Both types are characterized by the intersection pattern in the Lagrangian Grassmannian LG(2,4) = U(2)/O(2). The Sp(4,R)-equivalence class is determined by finitely many continuous parameters (Kahler angles).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"5ec49910d081d3c10a5c58f823fe101f7904368bc16784f413efde93af5dabeb","created":"2026-02-10T21:15:47.9661379Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
