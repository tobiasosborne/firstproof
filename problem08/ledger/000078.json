The node conflates two very different mathematical frameworks. (1) In TROPICAL GEOMETRY, a 4-valent vertex of a tropical curve in R^2 can be 'resolved' by replacing it with two 3-valent vertices connected by an edge. This is a combinatorial/piecewise-linear operation on the tropical curve. (2) The MATESSI-MIKHALKIN CONSTRUCTION takes a tropical curve (which must satisfy the balancing condition) and produces a smooth Lagrangian in (C*)^2 near the piecewise-linear Lagrangian lift. (3) The node's strategy is: take the 4-face polyhedral Lagrangian vertex -\u003e 'split' it into two 3-face vertices (tropical resolution step) -\u003e smooth each using Matessi-Mikhalkin (tropical-to-Lagrangian step). But: (a) The initial polyhedral Lagrangian surface may not arise as a lift of a tropical curve, so there is no tropical curve to resolve. (b) The 'splitting' operation — introducing a new face between two groups of faces — requires finding a NEW Lagrangian plane that is compatible with both groups, i.e., shares an edge direction with each group. The existence of such a plane is not proved. (c) Even if the splitting can be done combinatorially, the resulting 3-valent vertices must be lifts of balanced tropical vertices for the Matessi-Mikhalkin construction to apply. The node asserts this chain of operations without proving any single link.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
