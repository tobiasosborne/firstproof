Challenge ch-e3f2fa45614e3849 on node 1.2 established that Type B vertices (opposite half-planes coplanar, forming two transverse Lagrangian planes) CANNOT OCCUR at vertices of a polyhedral Lagrangian surface that is a topological submanifold. The link of such a vertex would be two disjoint circles (not a single simple closed curve), violating the manifold condition. The entire Polterovich surgery discussion in this node addresses an impossible case. While not logically wrong (a vacuously true statement is still true), it wastes proof real estate and misleads the reader about the actual structure. The node should acknowledge that only Type A vertices exist and that the tropical resolution is the sole mechanism needed.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
