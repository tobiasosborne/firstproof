The claim states 'edge smoothings have disjoint supports away from vertex balls.' For Phase B edge smoothing to work simultaneously, the tubular neighborhoods of distinct edges (outside vertex balls) must be disjoint.\n\nConsider two edges e_1, e_2 sharing a vertex v. After removing the vertex ball B_delta(v), the remnants of e_1 and e_2 emanate from the boundary of B_delta(v) in different directions. Their tubular neighborhoods are disjoint near B_delta(v) because the edges emerge in transverse Lagrangian planes. But the edges also connect to other vertices, and as we move along them, the tubular neighborhoods might approach each other if other edges are nearby.\n\nFor a compact polyhedral surface with finitely many edges and no accumulation, one can choose the tubular neighborhood radius epsilon small enough that all tubular neighborhoods are disjoint. This is a standard argument from the locally finite property of the cell decomposition.\n\nHowever, the argument must also ensure that the tubular neighborhood of an edge does not self-intersect with FACES of the polyhedral surface. The face interiors are smooth (flat Lagrangian planes), but an edge's tubular neighborhood extends into the ambient R^4 in directions TRANSVERSE to the surface. The surface is 2-dimensional in R^4 (codimension 2), so self-intersection of the tubular neighborhood with other faces is possible if faces come close to edges in the normal direction.\n\nThe claim needs: (1) explicit epsilon choice depending on the global geometry of K, (2) verification that edge tubular neighborhoods do not intersect each other or non-adjacent faces, (3) for non-compact K, a locally-finite epsilon-choosing argument. None of this is provided.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
