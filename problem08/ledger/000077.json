Node 1.3 is labeled as an 'assumption' (global hypothesis), but it is actually a CONSTRUCTION that should be PROVED. The node claims to construct a local Lagrangian smoothing — this is the core technical content of the proof, not an axiom. It should be a lemma whose proof references the Polterovich surgery construction and the Matessi-Mikhalkin tropical resolution, with explicit verification that the prerequisites of these constructions are satisfied.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
