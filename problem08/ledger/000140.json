Depends on: Node 1.2 (vertex classification and normal form), Node 1.3 (vertex smoothing via cotangent generating functions), Node 1.4 (edge smoothing via explicit Lagrangian profile replacement). Inference type: construction.\n\nSTATEMENT (Proposition). Let K be a finite polyhedral Lagrangian surface in (R^4, omega_std) with exactly 4 faces at every vertex. There exists a smooth embedded Lagrangian surface L and a compactly supported Hamiltonian H: R^4 -\u003e R (with supp(H) contained in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the 1-skeleton of K) such that the time-1 flow phi_H^1 satisfies phi_H^1(K) = L. Moreover, L agrees with K on the complement of the 1-skeleton neighborhood.\n\nSCOPE. Since K is a FINITE polyhedral complex (finitely many cells), K is compact. In particular, K has finitely many vertices v_1, ..., v_N and finitely many edges e_1, ..., e_M. The non-compact case does not arise under the problem hypotheses (a finite polyhedral complex has finitely many cells, each compact, so their union is compact). For completeness, we briefly address the locally-finite non-compact extension in Step 10.\n\nPROOF.\n\nSTEP 1 (PARAMETER CHOICES — VERTEX BALLS). For each vertex v_i (i = 1, ..., N), choose delta_i \u003e 0 such that: (a) delta_i \u003c (1/2) * min_{j != i} d(v_i, v_j). This ensures B_{delta_i}(v_i) cap B_{delta_j}(v_j) = emptyset for all i != j. (b) delta_i is small enough that B_{delta_i}(v_i) intersects only the edges and faces incident to v_i (possible since K is a finite complex, hence locally finite). (c) delta_i is small enough for Node 1.3's construction to apply in B_{delta_i}(v_i). Such delta_i exist because K is compact with finitely many vertices, so min_{i != j} d(v_i, v_j) \u003e 0.\n\nSTEP 2 (PARAMETER CHOICES — EDGE NEIGHBORHOODS AND TRANSITION ZONES). For each edge e_k connecting vertices v_i and v_j, choose a small parameter eta_k \u003e 0 (the transition zone width). Define the following subsets of the edge: (i) The vertex-ball interior: portions of e_k inside B_{delta_i}(v_i) and B_{delta_j}(v_j). (ii) The edge exterior: e_k^o = e_k setminus (B_{delta_i - eta_k}(v_i) cup B_{delta_j - eta_k}(v_j)), the portion of e_k outside slightly-shrunk vertex balls. (iii) The transition zones: the annular portions e_k cap (B_{delta_i}(v_i) setminus B_{delta_i - eta_k}(v_i)) and similarly at v_j.\n\nFor the edge exteriors, choose epsilon_k \u003e 0 such that the tubular neighborhoods T_{epsilon_k}(e_k^o) are pairwise disjoint for distinct edges. This is possible because K is a finite complex: the edge exteriors are finitely many compact line segments in R^4 with pairwise positive distances (after vertex ball removal, edges sharing a vertex are separated). Choose epsilon_k \u003c (1/2) * min_{j != k} d(e_k^o, e_j^o).\n\nSTEP 3 (PHASE A: VERTEX SMOOTHING). Apply Node 1.3's cotangent generating function construction independently at each vertex v_i.\n\nKEY FACTS FROM NODE 1.3 (critical for addressing challenges): Node 1.3 uses COTANGENT GENERATING FUNCTIONS — NOT tropical resolution. There is no topological modification, no introduction of new edges or vertices, no tropical splitting. The smooth Lagrangian L_{v_i} is topologically a disk (same as the PL cone). The construction produces a generating function F_final(X) = F_PL(X) + phi(|X|/delta_i) * (F_smooth(X) - F_PL(X)), where phi is a radial cutoff with phi(t) = 1 for t \u003c= 1/2 and phi(t) = 0 for t \u003e= 1.\n\nBOUNDARY CONDITION (AUTOMATIC): For |X| \u003e= delta_i, F_final = F_PL. The smoothed surface agrees EXACTLY with the original polyhedral surface K on and outside the boundary of B_{delta_i}(v_i). Inside B_{delta_i/2}(v_i), the surface is the smooth graph of dF_smooth. In the annular region, there is a smooth interpolation. The smoothing is Lagrangian (graph of exact 1-form dF_final). The smoothing is generated by a Hamiltonian H_{v_i} with supp(H_{v_i}) subset B_{delta_i}(v_i).\n\nDISJOINT SUPPORT PROPERTY: Since the balls B_{delta_i}(v_i) are pairwise disjoint (Step 1(a)), the Hamiltonians H_{v_1}, ..., H_{v_N} have pairwise disjoint supports. The combined Hamiltonian H_A = sum_{i=1}^{N} H_{v_i} is well-defined and smooth on R^4 (finite sum of smooth functions with pairwise disjoint supports). The Poisson brackets vanish: {H_{v_i}, H_{v_j}} = 0 for i != j (disjoint supports), so the simultaneous flow equals the composition in any order: phi_t^{H_A} = phi_t^{H_{v_1}} circ ... circ phi_t^{H_{v_N}}.\n\nDefine K_A = phi_1^{H_A}(K).\n\nPROPERTIES OF K_A: (i) Inside each B_{delta_i/2}(v_i): smooth Lagrangian (graph of dF_smooth). (ii) Outside all B_{delta_i}(v_i): K_A = K (unchanged — still PL with V-shaped edges). (iii) In each annular region: smooth Lagrangian (graph of dF_final, which is smooth everywhere by Node 1.3 Step 5(d)). (iv) On the boundary of each B_{delta_i}(v_i): K_A agrees exactly with K.\n\nCONCLUSION OF PHASE A: K_A is smooth inside each B_{delta_i}(v_i) and equals K outside. The remaining singularities are V-shaped creases along edge segments e_k^o outside all vertex balls.\n\nSTEP 4 (THE VERTEX-EDGE JUNCTION — KEY MATCHING ARGUMENT). This step resolves the critical challenge about edge-vertex boundary matching.\n\nConsider an edge e connecting vertices v and w, with vertex balls B_delta(v) and B_{delta_w}(w). After Phase A, the surface near the boundary of B_delta(v) along the edge has the following structure:\n\nINSIDE B_delta(v): the surface is graph(dF_final), which is smooth. Near the boundary (in the annular region delta/2 \u003c= |X| \u003c= delta), F_final = F_PL + phi(|X|/delta) * D(X) where D = F_smooth - F_PL. The correction D(X) is smooth, homogeneous of degree 2, and supported near sector boundaries (i.e., near edge projections).\n\nAT |X| = delta: phi = 0, so F_final = F_PL. The surface is the original PL surface K. Along the edge direction, the PL surface has a crease (jump in transverse derivative).\n\nOUTSIDE B_delta(v): the surface is K (PL, V-shaped along the edge).\n\nOBSERVATION: The crease at |X| = delta is NOT a problem for Phase A alone, because Phase A only claims smoothness INSIDE B_delta(v). The crease on the boundary is expected — it is the residual edge singularity that Phase B will handle.\n\nTHE MATCHING STRATEGY: We use the annular transition zone. Extend Phase A's effective radius by eta: redefine the cutoff so that Phase A smooths the creases out to radius delta + eta. Specifically, use phi(|X|/(delta + eta)) instead of phi(|X|/delta) in Node 1.3's formula. Then:\n- For |X| \u003c= (delta + eta)/2: F_final = F_smooth (fully smooth).\n- For |X| \u003e= delta + eta: F_final = F_PL (PL).\n- The surface is smooth everywhere inside B_{delta+eta}(v).\n\nPhase B then operates on the edge segment from radius delta + eta onward, where the surface is PL. The junction at |X| = delta + eta between Phase A (smooth) and Phase B (smooth) is handled as follows:\n\nPhase B's construction: In the edge-adapted coordinates from Node 1.4, both faces lie in {y_1 = 0}, and the V-shape is a profile in the (x_2, y_2)-plane. Phase B replaces this V-profile with a smooth curve. Near the boundary |X| = delta + eta, Phase B's Hamiltonian H_{e_k} is multiplied by a longitudinal cutoff chi_long(r) that smoothly transitions from 0 (at r = delta + eta) to 1 (at r = delta + eta + epsilon, for small epsilon \u003e 0).\n\nAt the junction r = delta + eta: Phase A gives a smooth surface. Phase B gives chi_long = 0, so Phase B does not modify the surface. The surface is therefore smooth (from Phase A). For r \u003e delta + eta + epsilon: Phase B gives chi_long = 1, fully smoothing the edge. The surface is smooth (from Phase B). In the transition epsilon-strip [delta + eta, delta + eta + epsilon]: Phase A's smoothing is tapering off (phi decreasing toward 0) while Phase B's smoothing is ramping up (chi_long increasing toward 1). But the SURFACE at r = delta + eta is already smooth (Phase A has smoothed it), so Phase B is deforming an already-smooth surface, which keeps it smooth. The Hamiltonian H_{e_k} * chi_long is smooth, and the flow of a smooth Hamiltonian preserves smoothness.\n\nCRITICAL POINT: The matching works because at the junction, Phase A has already produced a smooth surface. Phase B acts on this smooth surface, not on the PL surface. There is no mismatch to resolve — Phase B simply extends the smoothing further along the edge.\n\nSTEP 5 (PHASE B: EDGE SMOOTHING). After Phase A, the surface K_A has residual V-shaped singularities along the edge exteriors (portions of edges outside the extended vertex balls B_{delta_i + eta_i}(v_i)).\n\nFor each edge e_k, apply Node 1.4's construction to the exterior segment, with the following refinements:\n\n(a) CONSTANT PROFILE ON THE INTERIOR: On the bulk of the edge segment (away from both vertex balls), use Node 1.4's constant-profile construction: replace the V-shaped profile gamma_0 (two rays in the (x_2, y_2)-plane) with a smooth curve gamma_1. The surface L_{e_k} = {(x_1, gamma_1(s), 0, gamma_2(s))} is exactly Lagrangian for any smooth curve (Node 1.4, Step 4: omega pulls back to 0 identically because dy_1 = 0 and dx_2, dy_2 depend on the single parameter s).\n\n(b) LONGITUDINAL CUTOFF NEAR VERTEX BALLS: Near the endpoints of the edge segment (where it approaches a vertex ball), the profile gamma_t is smoothly deformed back to the original V-shape gamma_0 using a longitudinal cutoff chi_long(x_1). This makes the profile x_1-dependent.\n\nWhen the profile depends on x_1, the Lagrangian condition acquires a cross-term (Node 1.4, Step 6): iota*(omega) = (partial_{x_1} gamma_1 * partial_s gamma_2 - partial_s gamma_1 * partial_{x_1} gamma_2) dx_1 ^ ds. This vanishes iff the x_1-deformation preserves the curve up to reparametrization.\n\nRESOLUTION: We handle this by NOT using a longitudinal cutoff in the traditional sense. Instead, we observe that at the edge endpoints (near vertex ball boundaries), Phase A has already smoothed the surface. Phase B only needs to smooth the MIDDLE of the edge. So the Phase B Hamiltonian has compact support along the edge, bounded away from the vertex ball boundaries. At the support boundary of Phase B's Hamiltonian, the surface is already smooth (from Phase A), and Phase B does nothing (H = 0 there). This means the profile is constant (not x_1-dependent) throughout the Phase B support region, and the Lagrangian condition is automatic.\n\nMore precisely: for each edge e_k, Phase B's Hamiltonian H_{e_k} is supported in the set {p : d(p, e_k^o) \u003c epsilon_k and d(p, partial(vertex balls)) \u003e eta_k}. Inside this support, the profile is constant. Outside this support, the surface is already smooth (from Phase A near vertex balls, or is the original flat face away from edges).\n\n(c) FACE-EDGE JUNCTION: At the boundary of the edge smoothing in the transverse direction (moving away from the edge into a face), the smooth profile gamma_1 must transition back to the flat V-shape. This is achieved by choosing gamma_1 to agree with the original rays for |s| \u003e= T (i.e., gamma_1(s) = s * r_1 for s \u003e= T and gamma_1(s) = |s| * r_2 for s \u003c= -T). The edge smoothing modifies the surface only in a small transverse strip near the edge. Outside this strip, the surface is the original flat face, and the transition is smooth because gamma_1 smoothly approaches the rays.\n\n(d) DISJOINT SUPPORTS: The supports of H_{e_1}, ..., H_{e_M} are pairwise disjoint (Step 2). Therefore the edge Hamiltonians can be summed: H_B = sum_{k=1}^{M} H_{e_k}, with {H_{e_k}, H_{e_j}} = 0 for k != j. The simultaneous flow is well-defined.\n\nSTEP 6 (HAMILTONIAN ISOTOPY — SEQUENTIAL COMPOSITION). The total deformation K -\u003e L is realized as a sequential composition of two Hamiltonian flows:\n\nPhase A flow: K -\u003e K_A = phi_1^{H_A}(K), where H_A = sum_i H_{v_i}. Each H_{v_i} is compactly supported in B_{delta_i + eta_i}(v_i) (from Node 1.3).\n\nPhase B flow: K_A -\u003e L = phi_1^{H_B}(K_A), where H_B = sum_k H_{e_k}. Each H_{e_k} is compactly supported in the edge tubular neighborhood.\n\nThe total isotopy is the concatenation: phi_t^{total} = phi_{2t}^{H_A} for t in [0, 1/2] and phi_t^{total} = phi_{2t-1}^{H_B} circ phi_1^{H_A} for t in [1/2, 1]. This is a Hamiltonian isotopy from K to L. The total Hamiltonian is compactly supported: supp(H_A) cup supp(H_B) is contained in a neighborhood of the 1-skeleton of K.\n\nWHY SEQUENTIAL (not simultaneous): Phase A and Phase B do NOT have disjoint supports in general (they overlap in the annular transition zones near vertex ball boundaries). The sequential approach ensures that Phase B acts on K_A (the output of Phase A), not on K itself. This is necessary because Phase B's edge smoothing must start from the smooth surface produced by Phase A near vertex balls, not from the PL surface K. If applied simultaneously, the vertex and edge Hamiltonians would interfere in the transition zone, and the Poisson bracket {H_A, H_B} would be nonzero there.\n\nSTEP 7 (SMOOTHNESS VERIFICATION). We verify that L is a smooth submanifold of R^4.\n\n(A) Points inside B_{delta_i/2}(v_i): L = graph(dF_smooth), smooth by Node 1.3 Step 4. (Not modified by Phase B since Phase B's support is away from this region.)\n\n(B) Points in the Phase A annular zone, away from edges: L = graph(dF_final) restricted to face interiors, where F_final = F_PL = (1/2) X^T A_j X (smooth quadratic). Hence L is a flat Lagrangian plane. Smooth.\n\n(C) Points in the Phase A annular zone, near edges: L = graph(dF_final) where F_final smoothly interpolates between face generating functions via the angular partition of unity. Smooth by Node 1.3's construction.\n\n(D) Points along edge interiors (inside Phase B's support): L = phi_1^{H_B}(K_A). Here K_A is PL (V-shaped) and H_B smooths it via Node 1.4's construction. The result is a smooth Lagrangian by Node 1.4 Steps 3-5 (smooth curve in (x_2, y_2)-plane, product with x_1-line, automatically Lagrangian).\n\n(E) Points in the Phase B transition zone (boundary of Phase B's support near vertex balls): Here H_B is tapering to zero, and K_A is smooth (from Phase A). Phase B's flow phi_1^{H_B} applied to a smooth submanifold K_A at a point where H_B is smooth (and smoothly vanishing) yields a smooth submanifold. (A smooth diffeomorphism maps smooth submanifolds to smooth submanifolds.)\n\n(F) Face-edge junctions (away from vertices): The edge smoothing curve gamma_1 agrees with the face rays for |s| \u003e= T, so L transitions smoothly from the rounded profile to the flat faces. Smooth.\n\n(G) Face interiors (away from edges and vertices): L = K (unchanged). These are flat Lagrangian planes. Smooth.\n\nAll points of L are covered by cases (A)-(G). L is smooth.\n\nSTEP 8 (EMBEDDEDNESS VERIFICATION). L is embedded:\n\n(a) LOCAL EMBEDDEDNESS: Each local piece is embedded. Vertex smoothings are graph Lagrangians (Node 1.3 Step 6: the map X -\u003e (X, dF_final(X)) is injective). Edge smoothings are products of a line with an embedded curve (Node 1.4 Step 5). Face interiors are flat planes.\n\n(b) NO NEW INTERSECTIONS: L is obtained from K by Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms (first phi_1^{H_A}, then phi_1^{H_B}). Since K is embedded (by hypothesis, K is a topological submanifold of R^4) and Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms are smooth diffeomorphisms of R^4 (hence preserve embeddedness), L = phi_1^{H_B}(phi_1^{H_A}(K)) is embedded.\n\nMore explicitly: phi_1^{H_A} is a diffeomorphism of R^4, so K_A = phi_1^{H_A}(K) is an embedded submanifold (diffeomorphic to K). Similarly, phi_1^{H_B} is a diffeomorphism of R^4, so L = phi_1^{H_B}(K_A) is an embedded submanifold.\n\nSTEP 9 (LAGRANGIAN VERIFICATION). L is Lagrangian:\n\nK is a Lagrangian submanifold (piecewise, each face is Lagrangian, and K is a topological submanifold). The Hamiltonian flow phi_t^{H_A} preserves the symplectic form: (phi_t^{H_A})* omega = omega. Therefore for any smooth piece of K where omega|_K = 0, we have omega|_{K_A} = 0 on the corresponding piece of K_A. Since L = phi_1^{H_B}(K_A) and (phi_1^{H_B})* omega = omega, the Lagrangian condition is preserved.\n\nMore carefully: K is not a smooth submanifold, so \"omega|_K = 0\" requires interpretation. The correct statement is: each face of K is a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, and the Hamiltonian flow maps each face to a smooth Lagrangian piece of K_A. After Phase A, K_A is a smooth Lagrangian submanifold (it is smooth by Step 3 inside vertex balls, and outside it equals K which has PL singularities along edges). After Phase B, L is smooth everywhere and Lagrangian (being the image of the smooth Lagrangian K_A under a symplectomorphism, away from the PL singularities which have been resolved).\n\nAlternatively: the generating function argument gives Lagrangian-ness directly. Inside vertex balls, L = graph(dF_final), which is Lagrangian because it is the graph of an exact 1-form. Along edges, L is a product surface in {y_1 = 0}, which is Lagrangian by the computation in Node 1.4 Step 4. On face interiors, L = K is flat Lagrangian.\n\nSTEP 10 (NON-COMPACT EXTENSION). The problem statement specifies a FINITE polyhedral complex, which is compact. However, for the benefit of applications to locally-finite non-compact polyhedral Lagrangian surfaces (not required by the problem, but potentially relevant for edges extending to infinity as mentioned in the handoff):\n\n(a) LOCALLY-FINITE VERTEX SET: For a locally-finite polyhedral complex, the vertex set V is discrete (no accumulation points). Choose delta(v) = (1/3) * d(v, V setminus {v}) for each v in V. By local finiteness, d(v, V setminus {v}) \u003e 0, so delta(v) \u003e 0. The balls B_{delta(v)}(v) are pairwise disjoint.\n\n(b) INFINITE HAMILTONIAN SUM: H_A = sum_{v in V} H_v is a locally finite sum of smooth functions (any compact set meets finitely many supports). Hence H_A is a well-defined smooth function on R^4.\n\n(c) COMPLETENESS: If the vertex geometry is uniformly bounded (dihedral angles in [alpha_0, pi - alpha_0] for some alpha_0 \u003e 0, and edge lengths bounded below), then the H_v satisfy uniform C^k bounds on their supports, ensuring the Hamiltonian vector field X_{H_A} is complete (its flow exists for all time).\n\n(d) INFINITE EDGES: Edges extending to infinity receive a constant-profile smoothing (independent of the longitudinal coordinate), which extends smoothly to infinity. The Hamiltonian for such an edge is not compactly supported in the longitudinal direction, but it is compactly supported in the transverse directions. The flow is complete because the Hamiltonian vector field is tangent to the transverse (x_2, y_2)-plane and compactly supported there.\n\nSTEP 11 (SUMMARY). The global assembly proceeds as: (1) Choose disjoint vertex balls and edge neighborhoods (Steps 1-2). (2) Phase A: Apply Node 1.3's cotangent generating function smoothing at each vertex. Individual Hamiltonians have disjoint supports; they are SUMMED to produce the simultaneous flow (not composed — the sum H_A = sum H_{v_i} generates the simultaneous flow because {H_{v_i}, H_{v_j}} = 0). Result: K_A is smooth inside vertex balls, PL outside. (3) Phase B: Apply Node 1.4's profile replacement along each edge exterior. The edge smoothing has constant profile (Lagrangian condition is automatic). The Phase A/Phase B junction is smooth because Phase A smooths the surface past the vertex ball boundary, and Phase B acts on the resulting smooth surface. Result: L is smooth everywhere. (4) Sequential Hamiltonian isotopy: K -\u003e K_A -\u003e L, generated by H_A then H_B. The total Hamiltonian is compactly supported. (5) L is a smooth embedded Lagrangian submanifold.\n\nEND OF PROOF.","owner":"prover-1.5"}
