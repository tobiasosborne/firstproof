Part (e2) states 'K_t is a GRAPH Lagrangian: L_t = {(X, dG_t(X))} where G_t is the interpolating generating function'. This is only true LOCALLY near each vertex (in the local cotangent coordinates of Node 1.3). Globally, K_t is NOT a single graph over R^2 — it is assembled from local modifications at different vertices and edges (Node 1.5), each using different local coordinate systems. Different vertices may use different reference planes Lambda (even though a global Lambda exists by Part (d), the cotangent coordinates at different vertices are centered at different points). The correct statement is: K_t is LOCALLY a graph Lagrangian near each former vertex, and LOCALLY flat (unmodified) away from the 1-skeleton, and embeddedness is preserved because (i) graph Lagrangians are locally embedded, (ii) K was originally embedded, (iii) each local modification has compact support disjoint from all others (Node 1.5), so no new intersections are created. The conclusion (K_t is embedded) is correct, but the reason (single global graph) is wrong.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
