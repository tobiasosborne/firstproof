Part (a) computes the total Maslov index as sum of signatures: sign(A2-A1) + sign(A3-A2) + sign(A4-A3) + sign(A1-A4). However, EVERY consecutive difference matrix is singular: A2-A1 = diag(0,-1), A3-A2 = diag(-1,0), A4-A3 = diag(0,1), A1-A4 = diag(1,0). Each has a zero eigenvalue, meaning each consecutive pair of Lagrangian planes graph(A_i) and graph(A_{i+1}) intersect non-trivially (along a 1-dimensional subspace in the cotangent fiber). The standard Maslov index formula 'relative Maslov index between graph(A) and graph(B) equals the signature of (B-A)' applies to TRANSVERSE graph Lagrangians (where B-A is nonsingular). For non-transverse pairs, the correct tool is the Robbin-Salamon crossing form / spectral flow, and the contribution at a crossing depends on a choice of path through LG(2,4), not just the pair of endpoints. The proof treats 'signature' as well-defined for singular matrices (counting positive minus negative eigenvalues, ignoring zeros), which is a valid definition of signature, but the claim that summing these signatures gives the Maslov index of the loop is not justified for paths passing through non-transverse configurations. The CORRECT and much simpler argument for mu=0 is: all four planes lie in the cotangent chart {graph(A) : A symmetric 2x2}, which is an affine cell in LG(2,4) (homeomorphic to R^3). Any loop in a contractible space is null-homotopic, hence has Maslov index 0. This works regardless of transversality between consecutive planes. The node should use this contractibility argument instead of (or in addition to) the signature sum.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
