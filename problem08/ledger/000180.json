The sector angle at a vertex of a polygon face can range from 0 to 2*pi (for non-convex faces), so there is no a priori reason the arc is less than a semicircle. The conclusion (adjacent arcs share exactly one endpoint, hence link is a simple closed curve) IS correct, but follows from the topological manifold hypothesis (link of a point in a 2-manifold is S^1) rather than from the semicircle claim. The proof should either: (a) prove that sectors subtend angle \u003c pi (e.g., by arguing faces are convex near vertices, or by using the Lagrangian condition to constrain angles), or (b) invoke the manifold hypothesis directly: since K is a topological submanifold, the link of v is homeomorphic to S^1; the link consists of 4 great-circle arcs with non-adjacent arcs disjoint (Step 2); therefore the arcs form a simple closed curve. Route (b) is simpler and avoids the unjustified semicircle assumption entirely.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
