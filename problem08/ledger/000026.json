This is correct for vertex smoothings (supported in balls B_delta(v)) but FALSE for edge smoothings when K is non-compact. If K has unbounded edges (rays or lines extending to infinity, which occurs for any non-compact finite polyhedral complex), the edge smoothing Hamiltonian from node 1.4 is supported in a tubular neighborhood of the entire edge — which is non-compact. The Banyaga flux argument as stated applies to compactly supported symplectomorphisms. For non-compactly supported Hamiltonians, one needs either: (1) a separate argument that the Hamiltonian vector field is complete and generates a well-defined flow, or (2) a truncation/exhaustion argument (smooth edges in a ball of radius R, take R -\u003e infinity). The gap is fixable for R^4 (bounded Hamiltonian vector fields are complete, and the resulting diffeomorphism is still Hamiltonian by definition), but the argument as written is incorrect for non-compact K.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
