Here is the correct analysis: After a linear symplectomorphism of R^4 (which exists since all Sp(4,R) acts on flags), place the edge e along the x_1-axis. Both Lagrangian faces F_1, F_2 contain the e_1 direction; the Lagrangian condition omega(e_1, v) = 0 forces dy_1(v) = 0 for all tangent vectors v to either face. Hence both faces lie in the hyperplane {y_1 = 0}. In the transverse (x_2, y_2)-plane, the two half-faces trace rays at angles 0 and theta. ANY smooth curve replacing the V-profile in the (x_2, y_2)-plane automatically produces a Lagrangian surface: parametrize by (x_1, t) -\u003e (x_1, 0, gamma_1(t), gamma_2(t)); then omega pulls back to dx_1 ^ dy_1 + dx_2 ^ dy_2 = 0 + gamma_1'(t)*gamma_2'(t) dt^dt = 0. The symplectic form vanishes identically for ANY smooth profile, not just the piecewise-linear one. Therefore the claimed 'Moser-type correction with omega|_{K_mollified} = d(alpha_epsilon) with |alpha_epsilon|=O(epsilon)' is addressing a non-existent problem. The error alpha_epsilon is exactly zero, not O(epsilon). This indicates the proof author may not have performed the explicit coordinate computation and instead applied a generic soft argument (mollify then correct) where a direct explicit construction works. While the final CONCLUSION (edge singularity admits Lagrangian smoothing) is CORRECT, the METHOD described in the node is misleading and suggests the author did not verify the key computation.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
