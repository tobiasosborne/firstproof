Depends on: Node 1.2 (vertex classification), Node 1.3 (cotangent generating function construction). Inference type: lemma.\n\nSTATEMENT. Let K be a polyhedral Lagrangian surface in (R^4, omega_std) with exactly 4 faces at every vertex, and let K_t (t in (0,1]) be the smooth Lagrangian isotopy produced by the construction in Nodes 1.3-1.5. Then no topological, symplectic, or Floer-theoretic obstruction prevents the existence of K_t. Specifically: (a) the Maslov class of K_t is well-defined and extends the piecewise-constant Maslov data on K; (b) Floer-theoretic obstructions are absent (for non-compact K by exactness, for compact K by irrelevance to the smoothing method); (c) topological obstructions are absent (compact K must be a torus, non-compact K has no constraint); (d) no monodromy obstruction prevents global consistency of the construction; (e) regularity, embeddedness, energy, and h-principle concerns are addressed by the explicit construction. This node serves as a CONSISTENCY CHECK: it verifies that the smoothing produced by Nodes 1.3-1.5 does not violate any known obstruction to Lagrangian embeddings.\n\nPROOF.\n\nPART (a): MASLOV CLASS — EXPLICIT COMPUTATION.\n\nThe Maslov class mu in H^1(L; Z) of a smooth Lagrangian L in (R^4, omega_std) is the obstruction to trivializing the Lagrangian Gauss map gamma: L -\u003e LG(2,4), where LG(2,4) = U(2)/O(2) is the Lagrangian Grassmannian with pi_1(LG(2,4)) = Z generated by the Maslov class.\n\nFor the polyhedral Lagrangian K, the Gauss map is piecewise constant: on each face F_i, the tangent plane is a fixed Lagrangian plane Pi_i in LG(2,4). At a vertex v, the link (a simple closed curve in S^3 consisting of 4 great circle arcs) determines a loop in LG(2,4) by tracing the Lagrangian tangent planes: gamma_v = Pi_1 -\u003e Pi_2 -\u003e Pi_3 -\u003e Pi_4 -\u003e Pi_1 (cyclically).\n\nDefinition. The LOCAL MASLOV INDEX at vertex v is mu(v) := [gamma_v] in pi_1(LG(2,4)) = Z, i.e., the winding number of this loop of Lagrangian planes.\n\nComputation for Type A vertices. By Node 1.2, all vertices are Type A: four distinct Lagrangian planes Pi_1, Pi_2, Pi_3, Pi_4 in cyclic order, with consecutive planes sharing an edge (dim(Pi_i cap Pi_{i+1}) = 1) and non-consecutive planes transverse (Pi_i cap Pi_{i+2} = {0}).\n\nIn the Sp(4,R)-normal form (Node 1.3, Step 1), with gamma = 0: Pi_1 = span{e_1, e_2}, Pi_2 = span{e_1, e_4}, Pi_3 = span{e_3, e_4}, Pi_4 = span{e_2, e_3}, where omega = dx_1 ^ dy_1 + dx_2 ^ dy_2 with e_1=(1,0,0,0), e_2=(0,1,0,0), e_3=(0,0,1,0), e_4=(0,0,0,1).\n\nDirect computation via cotangent graph representation. In the cotangent graph coordinates of Node 1.3, the four planes are graphs of symmetric matrices A_1 = (1/2)Id, A_2 = diag(1/2,-1/2), A_3 = -(1/2)Id, A_4 = diag(-1/2,1/2). For graph Lagrangians over a common base, the relative Maslov index between graph(A) and graph(B) equals the signature of (B - A). The total Maslov index around the vertex loop is:\n\n  mu(gamma_v) = sign(A_2 - A_1) + sign(A_3 - A_2) + sign(A_4 - A_3) + sign(A_1 - A_4)\n\nwhere sign denotes signature. Computing each difference:\n  A_2 - A_1 = diag(0, -1): signature = -1 (eigenvalues 0, -1)\n  A_3 - A_2 = diag(-1, 0): signature = -1 (eigenvalues -1, 0)\n  A_4 - A_3 = diag(0, 1): signature = +1 (eigenvalues 0, 1)\n  A_1 - A_4 = diag(1, 0): signature = +1 (eigenvalues 1, 0)\n\nTotal: mu(gamma_v) = (-1) + (-1) + (+1) + (+1) = 0.\n\nThe total Maslov index around each vertex is ZERO. The loop of Lagrangian tangent planes around each vertex is null-homotopic in LG(2,4).\n\nFor general gamma: The matrices A_i(gamma) are continuous deformations of the gamma=0 case. Since the Maslov index is integer-valued and continuous in parameters, and equals 0 at gamma=0, it equals 0 for all gamma (as long as the configuration remains Type A, which is a generic open condition).\n\nConsequence for the smoothing: Since mu(v) = 0 at every vertex, the piecewise-constant Gauss map on K has trivial winding around every vertex. The smoothed Gauss map (from the partition-of-unity construction in Node 1.3, Step 4) extends the piecewise-constant map smoothly across vertices without Maslov class obstructions. The resulting smooth Lagrangian K_t has Maslov class mu(K_t) in H^1(K_t; Z) that restricts to 0 on every small loop around a former vertex.\n\nPART (b): FLOER THEORY — ANALYSIS SPLIT BY COMPACTNESS.\n\nThe original claim that \"R^4 exact implies K_t exact implies m_0 = 0\" is INCORRECT for compact Lagrangians. Corrected analysis:\n\nCASE 1: K non-compact. The Liouville form lambda = (1/2) sum_i (x_i dy_i - y_i dx_i) restricts to K_t. In the cotangent graph construction (Node 1.3), each local piece of K_t is the graph of an exact 1-form dF, so lambda restricts to an exact 1-form locally. If H^1(K_t; R) = 0 (e.g., K_t contractible), then K_t is exact. Even for non-compact K_t with nontrivial H^1, Floer theory for non-compact Lagrangians requires additional structure (wrapping, stops, etc.) and does not produce obstructions to the existence of K_t as a smooth Lagrangian. The smoothing question for non-compact K is purely local-to-global (Nodes 1.3-1.5) and requires no Floer-theoretic input.\n\nCASE 2: K compact (torus). If K is a compact polyhedral Lagrangian torus, K_t is a smooth compact Lagrangian torus. By Gromov (1985), there is NO closed exact Lagrangian in C^n, so K_t is NOT exact. Non-exact tori can bound holomorphic disks (Cho-Oh 2006: Clifford torus has m_0 != 0).\n\nHowever, this does NOT obstruct the smoothing: (i) The construction in Nodes 1.3-1.5 is PURELY LOCAL: it replaces singular neighborhoods with smooth Lagrangian patches using generating functions and compactly supported Hamiltonians, never invoking Floer theory. (ii) Floer-theoretic obstructions (m_0 != 0, obstructed A-infinity structures) concern the Fukaya-categorical properties of the RESULTING smooth Lagrangian, not the existence of the smoothing. (iii) No Floer-theoretic invariant of K is known to obstruct the existence of a smooth Lagrangian representative.\n\nConclusion: Floer-theoretic obstructions are IRRELEVANT to the smoothing problem. The smoothing construction is Floer-agnostic.\n\nPART (c): TOPOLOGICAL OBSTRUCTIONS.\n\nCOMPACT CASE. A compact Lagrangian surface L in (R^4, omega_std) satisfies chi(L) = 0 (Whitney: normal bundle isomorphic to tangent bundle via J). If L is non-orientable with chi = 0, then L is a Klein bottle, ruled out by Shevchishin (2009) and Nemirovski (2009). Therefore compact K must be a torus. Smooth Lagrangian tori exist abundantly in R^4 (product tori, Chekanov tori, etc.), so no topological obstruction arises.\n\nNON-COMPACT CASE. No topological obstruction: R^4 has trivial topology. For non-compact K, the Shevchishin-Nemirovski theorem does not apply (it requires compactness). A non-compact non-orientable Lagrangian surface (e.g., a Lagrangian Mobius-band-type configuration) could in principle exist in R^4. However, the local smoothing of Nodes 1.3-1.5 preserves local topology: it replaces each vertex neighborhood with a smooth disk and each edge neighborhood with a smooth strip. The global (non-)orientability is inherited from K, and since both orientable and non-orientable smooth non-compact Lagrangian surfaces can exist in R^4, no obstruction arises. If the polyhedral K is non-orientable and non-compact, its smoothing K_t is a smooth non-orientable non-compact Lagrangian surface — this is not obstructed.\n\nPART (d): MONODROMY — CANONICAL CHOICE ELIMINATES DISCRETE AMBIGUITY.\n\nThe original claim that the parameter space is contractible (\"product of half-lines\") is INCORRECT for a tropical-resolution-based construction. The corrected analysis, using the cotangent graph construction of Node 1.3:\n\nThe construction requires choosing a REFERENCE LAGRANGIAN PLANE Lambda transverse to all 4 tangent planes at each vertex. The set of valid choices at vertex v is: T(v) = LG(2,4) \\ (Sigma(Pi_1) cup ... cup Sigma(Pi_4)), where Sigma(Pi_i) is the codimension-1 Maslov cycle. The complement T(v) is open and dense in the connected 3-manifold LG(2,4).\n\nKEY POINT: Unlike a tropical resolution (which requires a DISCRETE partition of 4 faces into 2 pairs, giving 3 choices with pi_0 = Z/3), the cotangent graph method uses a SINGLE reference plane Lambda that makes ALL 4 faces simultaneously into cotangent graphs. A smooth partition of unity in the angular variable then produces the smooth generating function. The construction is CANONICAL once Lambda is chosen, with NO discrete choices.\n\nT(v) is connected: removing finitely many codimension-1 subvarieties from a connected manifold of dimension \u003e= 2 preserves connectedness. The constraints at different vertices are INDEPENDENT (supports are disjoint by Node 1.5, Phase A).\n\nA SINGLE global Lambda works for all vertices: T_global = LG(2,4) \\ union_{v,i} Sigma(Pi_i(v)) is the complement of finitely many codimension-1 subvarieties, hence open, dense, and connected. After fixing Lambda, the remaining parameters (cutoff radius delta \u003e 0, angular width alpha \u003e 0, cutoff function phi) live in products of open intervals — a contractible space. No monodromy obstruction arises.\n\nPART (e): ADDITIONAL OBSTRUCTION CATEGORIES.\n\n(e1) Regularity. The smoothing does NOT pass through intermediate regularity classes (C^1, C^{1,alpha}). Node 1.3 constructs the smooth Lagrangian DIRECTLY via a smooth generating function, bypassing any PL Darboux normal form. The absence of a PL Darboux theorem (Jauberteau-Rollin) is therefore not an obstruction: the construction uses the GLOBAL cotangent structure T*R^2 = R^4, requiring only the Lagrangian condition on each face (given) and transversality to a reference plane (Node 1.3, Step 2).\n\n(e2) Embeddedness. K_t is a GRAPH Lagrangian: L_t = {(X, dG_t(X))} where G_t is the interpolating generating function (Node 1.3, Step 7). A graph over R^2 is automatically embedded. Globally, disjoint-support patching (Node 1.5) ensures no new self-intersections.\n\n(e3) Energy bounds. The Hamiltonian H at each vertex satisfies ||H_v||_{C^0} = O(delta^2) (the generating function difference D(X) is homogeneous of degree 2, cut off at radius delta). Total energy: sum_v ||H_v|| = O(N * delta^2) \u003c infinity. As delta -\u003e 0, energy -\u003e 0, ensuring topological extension (Node 1.7).\n\n(e4) h-principle. The Gromov-Lees h-principle applies to Lagrangian IMMERSIONS, not embeddings. Our construction produces EMBEDDED Lagrangians (graph Lagrangians). We do not invoke the h-principle; the construction is explicit.\n\n(e5) Characteristic classes. Maslov class: computed in Part (a) (vanishes on vertex loops). Stiefel-Whitney: w_1(K_t) = w_1(K) (local smoothing preserves orientability). For orientable Lagrangian surfaces in R^4, w_2 is related to chi by w_2 = chi mod 2 = 0.\n\nPART (f): LOGICAL CONNECTION TO PROOF TREE.\n\nDependencies: Node 1.2 (vertex classification: Type A structure used in Parts (a) and (d)), Node 1.3 (cotangent generating function construction: determines which obstructions are relevant).\n\nRole: This node is a CONSISTENCY CHECK verifying that the smoothing of Nodes 1.3-1.5 does not violate known obstructions. The proof is logically complete without this node (Nodes 1.2-1.7 construct and verify the smoothing), but this node adds confidence by checking against a taxonomy of potential obstructions. If any obstruction analysis failed, it would indicate a bug in the construction, not a standalone failure.\n\nEND OF PROOF.","owner":"prover-1.8"}
