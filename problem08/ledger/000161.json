The correct dimension of the Lagrangian Grassmannian LG(n,2n) is n(n+1)/2, not n(n+1)/2+1. For n=2 this gives dim=3, which the node correctly uses elsewhere. The stated bound 'k \u003c= n(n+1)/2 + 1' is also logically unnecessary — the complement of k codimension-1 subvarieties in a connected d-manifold is nonempty for any finite k and any d \u003e= 1, so no bound on k in terms of dim is needed. The condition 'k=4 \u003c= 4' (using the wrong formula) or 'k=4 \u003c= 3+1' is not actually required by the proof logic; what matters is that k is finite and LG is connected of positive dimension.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
