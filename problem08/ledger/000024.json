{"type":"challenge_raised","timestamp":"2026-02-10T21:38:21.522996187Z","challenge_id":"ch-6e68452b0efab8aa","node_id":"1.8","target":"completeness","reason":"Exhaustiveness of obstruction categories: The node claims to check topological, symplectic, and Floer-theoretic obstructions via (a)-(d), but several important classes of obstructions are NOT addressed. (1) CHARACTERISTIC CLASS OBSTRUCTIONS: Beyond the Maslov class, there are other characteristic class obstructions to Lagrangian embeddings. For example, the Whitney class obstruction: for an orientable Lagrangian L in C^n, 2*c_1(TL) = 0 (where c_1 is the first Chern class of TL viewed via the identification TL tensor C = TM|_L). For a smoothed torus this is automatic, but for non-compact surfaces it should be checked. (2) REGULARITY OBSTRUCTIONS: The smoothing from polyhedral to smooth requires passing through an intermediate regularity. The node does not address whether C^1 or C^{1,alpha} regularity can be achieved as an intermediate step. Jauberteau-Rollin (2024) established that there is no PL Darboux theorem, meaning standard local normal form arguments fail. This is a genuine obstruction to the smoothing strategy that is not discussed in this node. (3) QUANTITATIVE OBSTRUCTIONS: Even if no topological obstruction exists, there could be quantitative obstructions — e.g., the smoothing might require arbitrarily large Hamiltonian energy, making the topological extension to t=0 fail. The node does not discuss energy bounds. (4) h-PRINCIPLE FAILURE: The Lagrangian condition is a first-order PDE (omega|_L = 0). The h-principle holds for Lagrangian IMMERSIONS (Gromov-Lees) but NOT for Lagrangian EMBEDDINGS in general. The node does not discuss whether the smoothing problem falls under the h-principle or requires additional geometric input. (5) INTERSECTION-THEORETIC OBSTRUCTIONS: For a compact Lagrangian torus in R^4, the self-intersection number is chi(L) = 0, but the smoothing must also preserve the embedding (no new self-intersections during smoothing). The node does not address whether the smoothing could introduce self-intersections that prevent an embedded result.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
