The proof states this without derivation, citing McDuff-Salamon and Guillemin-Sternberg. While the conclusion is correct (standard fact), the argument would be more self-contained with an explicit construction: the path Lambda(t) = e^{it/2} * R^2 for t in [0, 2pi] is a loop in LG(2,4) whose endpoint is the Lagrangian plane obtained by rotating R^2 by angle pi, which corresponds to the nontrivial component of O(2) (the reflection -I_2 has determinant -1 and stabilizes R^2 up to a reflection). This explicitly shows the boundary map delta: pi_1(LG) -\u003e pi_0(O(2)) is surjective, forcing the nontrivial extension.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
