This conflates two distinct flux concepts. (1) Banyaga's flux homomorphism is defined on the group of (compactly supported) symplectomorphisms: Flux: Symp_0^c(M) -\u003e H^1(M;R). When H^1(M;R)=0, every compactly supported symplectomorphism isotopic to the identity is Hamiltonian. (2) The flux of a Lagrangian isotopy L_t is a class in H^1(L_t;R), NOT in H^1(M;R). The vanishing of H^1(R^4;R) does NOT directly imply the vanishing of the Lagrangian isotopy flux in H^1(L_t;R) when H^1(L_t;R) is nontrivial (e.g., when L_t is a torus). The correct argument is: since nodes 1.3-1.5 construct K_t via ambient compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of R^4, the isotopy is Hamiltonian by construction. The standalone flux argument for abstract Lagrangian isotopies needs the additional observation that the ambient extension of the velocity field is closed on R^4 (not just on L_t), which follows automatically when the isotopy is already known to be ambient.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
