The phrase 'composition' is ambiguous. For Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms phi_1, phi_2 with disjoint support, their composition phi_2 circ phi_1 = phi_1 circ phi_2 (they commute because phi_i is the identity on the support of phi_j). More precisely, the Hamiltonians H_1, H_2 can be ADDED: H = H_1 + H_2 generates the simultaneous flow because [X_{H_1}, X_{H_2}] = X_{{H_1,H_2}} = 0 when supp(H_1) and supp(H_2) are disjoint. The resulting flow is phi_t^{H_1+H_2} = phi_t^{H_1} circ phi_t^{H_2}. The statement should say 'the SUM of compactly supported Hamiltonians with disjoint support generates the simultaneous flow' rather than 'the composition is well-defined.' The conclusion (simultaneous vertex smoothing works) is correct, but the mechanism is addition of Hamiltonians, not composition.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
