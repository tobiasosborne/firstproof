The moduli space of Type A vertices (after Sp(4,R) normalization) is 1-dimensional (parametrized by a single real parameter gamma). The product vertex (where the polyhedral surface locally looks like a product of two V-shaped curves in R^2) corresponds to a special value of gamma. For product vertices, smoothing is trivial: smooth each factor curve independently. For NON-PRODUCT vertices, the local structure is genuinely 4-dimensional and cannot be reduced to a product of 2-dimensional problems. The node does not distinguish between these cases. The tropical resolution is presumably aimed at non-product vertices, but the construction is not given. This means the node's argument has a logical gap even for the simplest non-product Type A vertex. At minimum, the node should: (a) identify the product case and handle it separately, (b) prove the tropical resolution works for at least one non-product vertex explicitly.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
