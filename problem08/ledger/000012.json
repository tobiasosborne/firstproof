In adapted symplectic coordinates the two half-planes differ only in a transverse profile; replace the V-shaped profile with a smooth convex curve, then apply a Moser-type correction (using omega|_{K_mollified} = d(alpha_epsilon) with |alpha_epsilon|=O(epsilon)) to restore the exact Lagrangian condition. The correction is generated by a compactly supported Hamiltonian.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"5ab9107c90cc99260e1238c7d506d0ababc0486f8ce70df6ffe2ecd97b3a3ab8","created":"2026-02-10T21:15:47.966149419Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
