Step 2 defines H_t = H_A for t in [0,1/2] (rescaled to [0,1]) and H_t = (phi_1^{H_A})* H_B for t in [1/2,1] (rescaled). The parenthetical '(rescaled to [0,1])' is ambiguous — does it mean H_A is run at double speed on [0,1/2], or that H_A runs on [0,1] and then gets compressed? In either interpretation, the Hamiltonian H_t has a discontinuity at t=1/2 unless both H_A and H_B vanish at the gluing time. Specifically: if H_A is rescaled so the flow completes by t=1/2 (i.e., replace H_A by 2*H_A on [0,1/2]), then at t=1/2^- the Hamiltonian is 2*H_A while at t=1/2^+ it jumps to 2*(phi_1^{H_A})* H_B. For a SMOOTH Hamiltonian isotopy, one needs a smooth time reparametrization: replace H_A by rho(t)*H_A where rho is a smooth bump with rho(t)=0 near t=0 and t=1/2, and integral_0^{1/2} rho(t) dt = 1 (and similarly for H_B on [1/2,1]). Without this reparametrization, the concatenated path is only piecewise smooth (continuous in the C^0 sense as a path of diffeomorphisms, but the HAMILTONIAN FUNCTION is discontinuous). The reference to McDuff-Salamon Prop. 5.4.6 is correct in that composition of Hamiltonian diffeos is Hamiltonian, but that proposition gives existence of SOME Hamiltonian generating the composition — the explicit formula here needs the time reparametrization to actually be smooth. This is a fixable gap but should be stated precisely.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
