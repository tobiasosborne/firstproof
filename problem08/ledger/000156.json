The Hessian D^2 F at a single point must be a CONSTANT symmetric matrix, not a function of theta (angle of approach). If the limiting Hessian depends on direction of approach, then the function is NOT C^2 at that point. For gamma=0: approaching origin along theta=0 (sector 1), the limiting Hessian is A_1 = (1/2)Id; along theta=pi (sector 3), it is A_3 = -(1/2)Id. These are different matrices, confirming F_smooth is not C^2 at origin. The node's parenthetical 'hence F_smooth is smooth at the origin by homogeneity degree 2' is a non sequitur — homogeneity degree 2 combined with direction-dependent Hessian implies the function is NOT C^2, which is the opposite of the claimed conclusion.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
