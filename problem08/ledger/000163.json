The map X -\u003e (X, dF_final(X)) is injective (since it is a graph), but embeddedness also requires that dF_final be continuous. In sector interiors, dF_final = A_i X (smooth). On edges at |X| \u003e= delta, dF_final = dF_PL which is continuous but has a crease (not differentiable) — but this is part of K, not L_final. For |X| \u003c delta, dF_final = dF_smooth (if the smoothness issue were fixed), which would be smooth. The argument is correct in principle but should note that embeddedness of a graph requires the map to be a homeomorphism onto its image, which for a graph over an open domain is automatic.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
