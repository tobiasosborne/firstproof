Any fix must address: (1) A smooth partition of unity rho_i(theta) generically introduces all Fourier modes; constraining rho_i to produce only modes n=0,+-2 in the product sum_i rho_i*q_i is highly non-trivial and likely impossible with a genuine partition of unity. (2) Alternative: use convolution smoothing (mollify F_PL), which preserves smoothness but (a) does not obviously give compact support, and (b) the smoothed function may not agree with F_PL on sector interiors. (3) Alternative: use a cutoff phi(|X|/delta) with phi=0 near 0 to avoid the origin entirely, but then the vertex singularity is never smoothed. The node needs a fundamentally different construction at the origin — for instance, choose F_smooth to be an explicit smooth quadratic form (e.g., (1/2)X^T A_0 X for some fixed A_0) near the origin, and transition to the angular interpolation away from 0 using a radial cutoff. This would give smoothness but requires verification that the resulting Lagrangian is topologically correct.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
