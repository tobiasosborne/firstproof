However, the detailed computation immediately following shows Pi_2 = span{e_1, e_4} follows directly from the Lagrangian and intersection conditions (b=0, c=0, d normalized to 1, and ae_1 absorbed into span{e_1}), without any shear. Moreover, applying such a shear would change Pi_3 = span{e_3, e_4} to span{e_3+B_{11}*e_1, e_4+B_{12}*e_1}, disturbing the normalization achieved in Step 4a. The shear discussion is vestigial from an earlier draft and should be removed to avoid confusion. The conclusion is unaffected.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
