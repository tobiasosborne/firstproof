(1) The claim 'R^4 is exact symplectic, so no non-constant holomorphic disks with boundary on exact Lagrangians' conflates two things. R^4 is indeed exact symplectic (omega = d(lambda)). For a SMOOTH exact Lagrangian L (meaning lambda|_L is exact), the area of any holomorphic disk with boundary on L vanishes by Stokes, hence no non-constant holomorphic disks exist. But the KEY ISSUE is: is the smoothed Lagrangian K_t necessarily exact? For compact K_t (a torus), a compact Lagrangian torus in R^4 IS exact (since H^1(R^4;R)=0, the Liouville class [lambda|_L] in H^1(L;R) vanishes — wait, this is FALSE. The standard Clifford torus {|z_1|=|z_2|=1} in R^4=C^2 is Lagrangian but NOT exact: the integral of lambda over a generating circle is the enclosed area, which is pi \\!= 0. So compact Lagrangian tori in R^4 are generically NOT exact.) (2) The Gromov theorem states there is no CLOSED exact Lagrangian in C^n, so if K_t is a compact torus, it cannot be exact, and therefore m_0=0 does NOT follow from exactness. Instead m_0 could be nonzero. (3) For non-compact K_t, exactness may hold (if K_t is a plane or cylinder with vanishing Liouville class), but this is not automatic and needs proof. (4) Even if Floer theory is unobstructed, the node does not explain how this relates to the smoothing problem. Floer-theoretic obstructions are about deforming Lagrangians in the Fukaya category, not about smoothing polyhedral ones. The relevance of m_0=0 to the smoothing question is never established. (5) The statement 'Floer theory is unobstructed' usually means the A-infinity structure on the Lagrangian Floer complex is well-defined — this is a different claim from 'no obstruction to smoothing.'","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
