Phase A: smooth all vertices simultaneously using disjoint balls B_delta(v) (supports are disjoint so no interference; the composition of compactly supported Hamiltonians with disjoint support is well-defined). Phase B: smooth all remaining edge singularities (after Phase A, edges meet vertex regions in smooth Lagrangian arcs; edge smoothings have disjoint supports away from vertex balls). The sequential approach avoids nonlinear patching issues inherent in partitions of unity for the Lagrangian condition.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"d7800507606fb0e2f82ea225b89cd28a051d62ce097df330a196713a143b48d2","created":"2026-02-10T21:15:47.966153878Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
