Since D(X) is NOT smooth at the origin (see the smoothness-at-origin challenge), H is not smooth on R^4, and the Hamiltonian vector field X_H is not well-defined at points above the origin. The flow is therefore not a smooth map, and in particular phi_H^1 is not a diffeomorphism near the origin. This means the set-theoretic image phi_H^1(K) is not guaranteed to be a smooth submanifold. The node needs to either (a) fix D to be smooth at origin, or (b) use a different method to construct the Hamiltonian isotopy that avoids the origin singularity.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
