After the critical challenge on node 1.2 (ch-e3f2fa45614) establishing that Type B vertices are impossible, ALL vertices are Type A. Phase A must use tropical resolution at every vertex.\n\nThe tropical resolution is a multi-step process: (1) split 4-valent vertex into two 3-valent vertices + connecting edge, (2) smooth each 3-valent vertex via Matessi-Mikhalkin. But this is NOT a simple 'smoothing in a ball.' It is a TOPOLOGICAL MODIFICATION: the resolved surface has different topology near v (one vertex becomes two vertices plus an edge, the genus/connectivity changes locally).\n\nPhase A as described ('smooth all vertices simultaneously using disjoint balls') makes it sound like each vertex smoothing is a small perturbation within a ball. But tropical resolution is a surgery operation that changes the combinatorial structure of K. The description should be:\n\nPhase A (corrected): For each vertex v, within B_delta(v):\n  (A1) Perform tropical resolution: split the 4-valent vertex into two 3-valent vertices v', v'' connected by a new edge segment e_new of length proportional to a parameter lambda.\n  (A2) Smooth each 3-valent vertex v', v'' using the Matessi-Mikhalkin pair-of-pants.\n  (A3) Smooth the new connecting edge e_new (which is a dihedral singularity between the two pair-of-pants regions).\n  (A4) Ensure the result matches the original flat faces at the boundary of B_delta(v).\n\nSteps A2-A4 are not simple and require their own justification. The node conflates all of this into 'smooth all vertices' without acknowledging the complexity of the construction.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
