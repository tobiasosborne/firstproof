The Matessi (2021) construction of Lagrangian submanifolds from tropical hypersurfaces has specific prerequisites that are not addressed: (1) TROPICAL BALANCING: Matessi's construction (arXiv:1804.01469) requires the tropical curve to satisfy the balancing condition at each vertex. For a 3-valent vertex with edge directions v_1, v_2, v_3 in Z^2, this means w_1 v_1 + w_2 v_2 + w_3 v_3 = 0 with positive integer weights. A general 3-Lagrangian-plane configuration at a vertex of a polyhedral surface does NOT automatically satisfy this — the balancing condition is a constraint on the PROJECTED edge directions in the base of the torus fibration, not a condition on arbitrary Lagrangian planes. (2) AMBIENT SPACE: The Matessi-Mikhalkin construction lives in (C*)^2, not R^4. The standard symplectic form on (C*)^2 restricts to omega_std on each fiber, but the global topology differs. Transferring the construction to R^4 requires embedding (C*)^2 into C^2 and controlling the behavior near the coordinate axes. (3) EMBEDDEDNESS: Matessi's construction produces immersed Lagrangians in general; embeddedness requires additional conditions on the tropical curve (e.g., simple, smooth tropical curve). The node does not address whether the resolved 3-valent configurations yield embedded Lagrangians.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
