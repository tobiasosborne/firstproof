Step 9 paragraph 1 says: 'K is a Lagrangian submanifold (piecewise)...The Hamiltonian flow phi_t^{H_A} preserves the symplectic form...Therefore omega|_{K_A} = 0.' The problem: The Hamiltonian flow preserves omega|_L = 0 only for smooth Lagrangian submanifolds L where the tangent space is well-defined at every point. For K, the tangent space is NOT defined at vertices and edges (where K has PL singularities). The correct mathematical statement would be: for each open face F_i of K (which IS a smooth Lagrangian), phi_t(F_i) is a smooth Lagrangian. But this only verifies the Lagrangian condition on the IMAGES of the open faces, NOT at the images of the singular points (vertices, edges). At singular points, one needs a SEPARATE argument. The 'more careful' paragraph acknowledges this but then asserts 'After Phase B, L is smooth everywhere and Lagrangian (being the image of the smooth Lagrangian K_A under a symplectomorphism, away from the PL singularities which have been resolved).' But K_A is NOT smooth — it is smooth inside vertex balls but PL along edge exteriors. Phase B acts on K_A which still has PL singularities along edges. The 'image of smooth Lagrangian under symplectomorphism' argument does not apply to K_A at its edge singularities. The ALTERNATIVE generating-function argument in the next paragraph is valid and should be the primary argument. The first argument should be deleted or corrected.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
