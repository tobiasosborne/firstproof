Step 5(c) claims: 'The smooth profile gamma_1 agrees with the original rays for |s| \u003e= T, so the edge smoothing modifies the surface only in a small transverse strip near the edge. Outside this strip, the surface is the original flat face, and the transition is smooth because gamma_1 smoothly approaches the rays.' However, gamma_1 'smoothly approaching the rays' means gamma_1(s) = s*r_1 for s \u003e= T. This is smooth along the ray, but the issue is what happens at s=T: does the function s -\u003e gamma_1(s) have a smooth junction at s=T, transitioning from the rounded profile to the straight ray? If gamma_1 is chosen to agree EXACTLY with the ray for s \u003e= T and to be a smooth curve for s \u003c T, then all derivatives of gamma_1 must agree with those of the linear function at s=T. A standard bump function can achieve this (flat functions at endpoints), so the junction CAN be made C-infinity. But the node does not specify that gamma_1 is chosen with this property. It merely says gamma_1 'agrees with the ray for |s| \u003e= T'. If gamma_1 approaches the ray only asymptotically (not with finite-order tangency), the transition is smooth. If it equals the ray exactly for s \u003e= T, smooth transition at s=T requires all derivatives to match (automatic for the flat profile, since the ray is linear). The claim is correct but the reasoning should note that FLAT TRANSITION is required at s=T.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
