For the tangent cone of 4 sectors to be a topological disk, the link in S^3 must be a SIMPLE closed curve. This requires: (1) all 4 edge rays are distinct, (2) non-adjacent great-circle arcs in S^3 do not intersect. Condition (1) follows from the polyhedral complex structure (distinct faces), but must be argued. Condition (2) needs proof: for non-adjacent arcs to be disjoint on S^3, the Lagrangian planes containing them must not share any direction on the relevant arcs. In the Type A case (non-consecutive planes transverse), the non-adjacent arcs live in 2-planes with trivial intersection, so they are disjoint on S^3 (verified for the standard example). But this argument applies to Type A only and must be stated explicitly. The claim also fails to address whether the disk condition constrains which 4-plane configurations can arise — it merely asserts the property without proving it follows from the hypotheses.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
