Step 5 explicitly acknowledges the problem: when the profile depends on x_1, the pullback iota*(omega) = (partial_{x1} gamma_1 * partial_s gamma_2 - partial_s gamma_1 * partial_{x1} gamma_2) dx_1 ^ ds, which is generically nonzero. The RESOLUTION claims: Phase B has constant profile throughout its support, 'bounded away from vertex ball boundaries,' so the cross-term never arises. But this creates a contradiction with Step 4: Step 4 says Phase B uses chi_long(r) to ramp up from 0 to 1 near the vertex ball boundary, making the deformation r-dependent (and hence x_1-dependent along the edge). If the Hamiltonian H_{e_k} * chi_long(r) generates a flow, and chi_long depends on r (which correlates with x_1 along the edge), then the resulting profile IS x_1-dependent in the transition strip. Specifically, the flow phi_1^{chi_long * H_{edge}} does not produce a constant-profile surface in the region where chi_long is varying. The proof cannot have it both ways: either Phase B uses chi_long (Step 4), in which case the profile is x_1-dependent and the Lagrangian cross-term is nonzero; or Phase B uses constant profile with no cutoff (Step 5 RESOLUTION), in which case the matching at vertex balls is unaddressed. The tension between Steps 4 and 5 is unresolved.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
