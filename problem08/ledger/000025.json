But it makes claims that REQUIRE other nodes to be established first, and conversely, other nodes implicitly depend on it. (1) Sub-claim (b) states the smoothed Lagrangian K_t is exact — but whether K_t is exact depends on HOW it was constructed (nodes 1.3-1.5). For a compact torus K, Gromov's theorem says it CANNOT be exact. This means the sub-claim is either false (for compact K) or requires the non-compact case from the construction. The node cannot be verified independently of nodes 1.3-1.5. (2) Sub-claim (d) about monodromy explicitly references the local smoothing constructions from node 1.3 (Polterovich surgery parameter, tropical resolution partition). It cannot be verified as an independent 'assumption' — it depends on node 1.3. (3) The node is framed as 'no obstructions prevent the smoothing' but this is a CONCLUSION of the analysis, not an assumption. The proof tree lists this as a sibling of nodes 1.1-1.7, but logically it should be a verification step that comes AFTER the construction (nodes 1.2-1.7) is established, to confirm that no global obstruction was missed. Its inference type should be 'claim' dependent on nodes 1.2, 1.3, and potentially others, not a standalone 'assumption'. (4) As currently positioned with no dependencies, it creates a logical gap: the proof assembles local smoothings (1.3-1.5) and checks Hamiltonian isotopy (1.6) and topological extension (1.7), but never formally connects to the obstruction analysis (1.8). Which nodes USE the output of 1.8? If none, this node is logically disconnected from the proof.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
