By Gromov's 1985 theorem, there is NO closed (compact without boundary) exact Lagrangian submanifold in C^n. Therefore if K is a compact polyhedral Lagrangian torus and K_t is a smooth compact Lagrangian torus, then K_t is NOT exact. Since K_t is not exact, the no-holomorphic-disk argument fails: there CAN be holomorphic disks with boundary on a non-exact Lagrangian torus in C^2. Indeed, this is well-known: the Clifford torus in C^2 bounds Maslov index 2 holomorphic disks (Cho-Oh 2006). Therefore m_0 \\!= 0 in general for compact Lagrangian tori, and the Floer theory claim as stated is FALSE for the compact case. The node's reasoning (R^4 exact =\u003e K_t exact =\u003e no disks =\u003e m_0=0) has a broken second step: the ambient exactness does NOT imply the Lagrangian submanifold is exact. This is a basic but critical error.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
