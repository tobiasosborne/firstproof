If opposite half-planes are coplanar (Pi_1=Pi_3, Pi_2=Pi_4), then all 4 edges lie in L_1 ∩ L_2. Case dim(L_1∩L_2)=0: no edges possible. Case dim(L_1∩L_2)=1: at most 2 distinct edge rays =\u003e link degenerates (not a simple closed curve). Case dim(L_1∩L_2)=2: L_1=L_2, not two distinct planes. In all cases, the tangent cone union L_1 ∪ L_2 has link = two disjoint S^1 (if transverse) or figure-8 (if sharing a line), neither homeomorphic to S^1. Therefore Type B CANNOT OCCUR at a vertex of a polyhedral Lagrangian surface that is a topological submanifold. The classification should state: all vertices are Type A. This error propagates to Node 1.3, which invokes Polterovich surgery for Type B vertices that do not exist.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
