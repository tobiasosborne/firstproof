Explicit computation shows that after Sp(4,R)-normalization, the moduli space of Type A vertex configurations is exactly 1-dimensional, parametrized by a single real parameter gamma (the coefficient in Pi_4 = span{e2, gamma*e1+e3}). The phrase 'finitely many continuous parameters' is technically correct but unhelpfully vague; it should state 'one continuous parameter.' Furthermore, calling this parameter a 'Kahler angle' is not strictly accurate: Kahler angles characterize PAIRS of Lagrangian planes, whereas gamma is an invariant of the 4-tuple configuration that cannot be reduced to a single pairwise Kahler angle.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
