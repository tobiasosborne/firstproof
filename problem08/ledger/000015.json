The Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms Phi_t generating K_t satisfy |Phi_t - id|_{C^0} -\u003e 0 on compact sets (since the generating Hamiltonians H_t -\u003e 0 in C^0), providing uniform convergence to a homeomorphism Phi_0 with Phi_0(K_epsilon)=K. This gives the required topological isotopy on [0,1] with K_0=K.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"e93f245c8f56e61340496c6b06775ee4eb5979616da186da0f1ea288e15f1ba0","created":"2026-02-10T21:15:47.966159173Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
