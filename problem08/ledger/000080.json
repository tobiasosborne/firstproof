The node presents only two mechanisms (Polterovich surgery for Type B, tropical resolution for Type A) but there are at least two other approaches that could work and should be discussed: (1) DIRECT LAGRANGIAN INTERPOLATION: Since the Lagrangian Grassmannian LG(2,4) is connected (it is U(2)/O(2), a compact 3-manifold), one might construct a smooth Lagrangian by interpolating between the four Lagrangian planes using a path in LG(2,4). This would give a smooth Lagrangian disk near the vertex as a union of Lagrangian planes varying smoothly with the angular coordinate. This requires showing the resulting surface is embedded and exactly Lagrangian (not just approximately). (2) GRAPH-BASED SMOOTHING: For the standard Type A example, express two of the four faces as Lagrangian graphs over the other two. Then use a convolution/mollification on the graph function and correct the Lagrangian condition using Moser. (3) The HANDOFF document itself mentions (in the 'Alternative for Type A' paragraph): 'Could use a direct interpolation in LG(2,4) — sweep from the 4-face configuration to a smooth Lagrangian disk via a path of Lagrangian planes. The contractibility of LG(2,4) ensures such a path exists.' But LG(2,4) is NOT contractible (pi_1 = Z), so even this fallback has an error.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
