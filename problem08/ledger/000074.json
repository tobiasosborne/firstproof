The node is marked with inference type 'assumption' (global hypothesis). But this is NOT an assumption — it is a CONSTRUCTION CLAIM that assembles the outputs of nodes 1.2-1.4 into a global result. The correct inference type would be 'claim' with dependencies on 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4. As an 'assumption,' it is logically disconnected from the rest of the proof tree: the proof claims local smoothings exist (1.3, 1.4) and claims they can be assembled globally (1.5), but these claims are listed as independent assumptions rather than as a chain of deductions. This structural issue means the proof tree does not actually represent a valid logical argument — it is a collection of unconnected assertions. Each 'assumption' node is logically independent, and accepting all of them simultaneously does not constitute a proof unless the dependency structure is made explicit.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
