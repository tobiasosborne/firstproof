Depends on: Node 1.3 (vertex smoothing), Node 1.4 (edge smoothing), Node 1.5 (global assembly), Node 1.6 (Hamiltonian isotopy). Inference type: lemma.\n\nSTATEMENT. The Hamiltonian isotopy K_t constructed in Nodes 1.3-1.6 extends continuously to t=0 in the Hausdorff topology, with K_0 = K. That is, the map [0,1] -\u003e {closed subsets of R^4} given by t -\u003e K_t is continuous at t=0 when the codomain is equipped with the Hausdorff metric.\n\nPROOF.\n\nThe proof proceeds in three parts: (1) vertex generating function convergence as the inner-zone radius shrinks to zero, (2) edge profile convergence as the rounding parameter goes to zero, (3) global Hausdorff distance estimate showing the smooth surfaces converge to the polyhedral surface.\n\nSTEP 1 (VERTEX GENERATING FUNCTION CONVERGENCE).\n\nRecall from Node 1.3 (Session 5 rewrite, two-zone construction) that the vertex smoothing uses a family of generating functions parametrized by an inner-zone radius epsilon(t) = (delta/8)*tau(t), where tau: [0,1] -\u003e [0,1] is smooth with tau(0) = 0, tau(1) = 1, and tau flat at t=0 (all derivatives tau^{(k)}(0) = 0 for k \u003e= 1).\n\nFor t in (0,1], the smooth generating function is:\n\n  G_t(X) = F^{(epsilon(t))}(X) = chi(|X|/epsilon(t)) * F_angular(X),\n\nwhere:\n- chi: R -\u003e [0,1] is smooth with chi(s) = 0 for s \u003c= 1, chi(s) = 1 for s \u003e= 2, and chi flat at both transitions,\n- F_angular(X) = sum_{i=1}^4 rho_i(theta(X)) * (1/2)X^T A_i X is smooth on R^2 \\ {0} (the angular partition of unity interpolation between the four face generating functions),\n- F_PL is the piecewise-linear generating function (F_PL = F_i = (1/2)X^T A_i X on sector closure(Omega_i)).\n\nThe smooth Lagrangian surface is L_t = Graph(dG_t) restricted to B_delta(v).\n\nPOINTWISE CONVERGENCE OF G_t TO F_PL. Fix X in R^2 \\ {0}.\n\n(a) If X lies in a sector interior Omega_i (away from the sector boundaries, i.e., the coordinate axes): then F_angular(X) = F_i(X) = F_PL(X) (since rho_i = 1 deep inside sector i and F_i equals the restriction of F_PL to that sector).\n\n(b) For t \u003e 0 small enough that epsilon(t) \u003c |X|/2: we have |X|/epsilon(t) \u003e 2, so chi(|X|/epsilon(t)) = 1. Therefore G_t(X) = F_angular(X) = F_PL(X) on sector interiors.\n\n(c) As t -\u003e 0+: epsilon(t) -\u003e 0 (since tau(0) = 0). For any fixed X != 0, eventually epsilon(t) \u003c |X|/2, so chi(|X|/epsilon(t)) = 1 for all t sufficiently small. Thus G_t(X) -\u003e F_angular(X) = F_PL(X).\n\n(d) On sector boundaries (the four coordinate semi-axes): F_angular smoothly interpolates between adjacent face values across the angular transition strips. As epsilon(t) -\u003e 0, chi(|X|/epsilon(t)) -\u003e 1 for all X != 0, so G_t(X) -\u003e F_angular(X). On the boundary between sectors i and j, F_angular equals F_i = F_j (since F_PL is continuous across sector boundaries, and F_angular is a smooth interpolation that matches F_PL at sector interiors and transitions smoothly across boundaries). Therefore G_t(X) -\u003e F_PL(X) on sector boundaries as well.\n\n(e) At X = 0: G_t(0) = chi(0) * F_angular(0) = 0 for all t (since chi(0) = 0 and F_angular(0) = 0). Also F_PL(0) = 0. So G_t(0) = F_PL(0) = 0 for all t.\n\nCONCLUSION: G_t(X) -\u003e F_PL(X) pointwise on all of R^2 as t -\u003e 0+.\n\nSTEP 2 (C^0 CONVERGENCE OF VERTEX SMOOTHING SURFACES).\n\nThe smooth Lagrangian is L_t = Graph(dG_t) = {(X, dG_t(X)) : X in B_delta(v)} subset R^4.\nThe polyhedral Lagrangian is K_v = Graph(dF_PL) restricted to the vertex neighborhood.\n\nGRADIENT CONVERGENCE. For X in a sector interior Omega_i with |X| \u003e 2*epsilon(t):\n\n  dG_t(X) = d(F_angular(X)) = d(F_PL(X)),\n\nsince G_t = F_angular = F_PL on this region. So dG_t(X) = dF_PL(X) exactly.\n\nFor |X| \u003c= 2*epsilon(t) (the inner and transition zones):\n\n  dG_t(X) = d(chi(|X|/epsilon(t)) * F_angular(X))\n          = chi'(|X|/epsilon(t)) * (X/|X|) * (1/epsilon(t)) * F_angular(X) + chi(|X|/epsilon(t)) * dF_angular(X).\n\nSince F_angular(X) = O(|X|^2), we have F_angular(X) = O(epsilon(t)^2) on {|X| \u003c= 2*epsilon(t)}. Similarly, dF_angular(X) = O(|X|) = O(epsilon(t)). The cutoff derivative chi' is bounded. Therefore:\n\n  |dG_t(X) - dF_angular(X)| = O(epsilon(t))   on {|X| \u003c= 2*epsilon(t)}.\n\nSince dF_angular is smooth on R^2 \\ {0} and F_angular = F_PL on sector interiors, we have (for X on the PL surface near a sector boundary):\n\n  |dG_t(X) - dF_PL(X)| = O(epsilon(t)).\n\nHAUSDORFF DISTANCE ESTIMATE AT A SINGLE VERTEX. The Hausdorff distance between two graphs over the same base is controlled by the sup-norm of the difference of their fiber values. For L_t = Graph(dG_t) and K_v = Graph(dF_PL):\n\n  d_H(L_t cap B_delta(v), K_v cap B_delta(v)) \u003c= sup_{X in B_delta(v)} |dG_t(X) - dF_PL(X)|.\n\nFrom the analysis above:\n- On {|X| \u003e 2*epsilon(t)} cap B_delta(v): dG_t = dF_PL (exactly on sector interiors).\n- On {|X| \u003c= 2*epsilon(t)}: |dG_t - dF_PL| = O(epsilon(t)).\n\nSince 2*epsilon(t) = 2*(delta/8)*tau(t) = (delta/4)*tau(t) -\u003e 0 as t -\u003e 0, the region where dG_t differs from dF_PL shrinks to {0}. On this region, the deviation is O(epsilon(t)) -\u003e 0. Therefore:\n\n  d_H(L_t cap B_delta(v), K_v cap B_delta(v)) = O(epsilon(t)) -\u003e 0   as t -\u003e 0.\n\nSTEP 3 (EDGE PROFILE CONVERGENCE).\n\nFrom Node 1.4 (edge smoothing via explicit Lagrangian profile), the edge smoothing replaces the V-shaped transverse profile with a smooth curve gamma_epsilon(s) in the (x_2, y_2)-plane. The parameter epsilon controls the rounding radius near the origin of the V.\n\nNODE 1.4 CONSTANT-PROFILE CONSTRUCTION. In the edge-adapted Darboux coordinates, the polyhedral edge has the V-shaped profile:\n\n  gamma_0(s) = s * r_1   for s \u003e= 0,\n  gamma_0(s) = |s| * r_2   for s \u003c 0,\n\nwhere r_1, r_2 are unit vectors in the (x_2, y_2)-plane (the two face directions).\n\nThe smooth profile gamma_epsilon is chosen so that:\n- gamma_epsilon(s) = gamma_0(s) for |s| \u003e= S (agrees with the V outside a compact set),\n- gamma_epsilon smoothly rounds the corner in {|s| \u003c S}, with the rounding contained in a ball of radius epsilon around the origin.\n\nFor the isotopy {gamma_t}_{t in [0,1]}, with gamma_t -\u003e gamma_0 (the V-shape) as t -\u003e 0:\n\nHAUSDORFF CONVERGENCE. The smoothed edge surface is L_t^edge = {(x_1, gamma_t(s), 0, gamma_t(s)) : x_1 in I, s in R}, where I is the edge segment interval (after removing vertex balls).\n\nThe polyhedral edge is K_edge = {(x_1, gamma_0(s), 0, gamma_0(s)) : x_1 in I, s in R}.\n\nSince gamma_t converges uniformly to gamma_0 on compact s-intervals (the rounding shrinks to radius 0), we have:\n\n  d_H(L_t^edge, K_edge) \u003c= sup_{s in R} |gamma_t(s) - gamma_0(s)| -\u003e 0   as t -\u003e 0.\n\nSTEP 4 (GLOBAL HAUSDORFF CONVERGENCE).\n\nThe global smooth surface K_t is assembled from vertex smoothings (Phase A) and edge smoothings (Phase B), as described in Node 1.5. The polyhedral surface K is the union of vertex neighborhoods (PL cones) and edge segments (V-shaped profiles).\n\nVERTEX CONTRIBUTIONS. From Step 2, for each vertex v:\n\n  d_H(K_t cap B_delta(v), K cap B_delta(v)) = O(epsilon(t)) -\u003e 0.\n\nEDGE CONTRIBUTIONS. From Step 3, for each edge e:\n\n  d_H(K_t cap N_epsilon(e^o), K cap N_epsilon(e^o)) -\u003e 0,\n\nwhere N_epsilon(e^o) is the tubular neighborhood of the edge exterior (outside vertex balls) and the convergence follows from the uniform convergence of the smooth profile to the V-shape.\n\nJUNCTION REGIONS. At the Phase A/Phase B junctions (where vertex balls meet edge tubular neighborhoods), the convergence follows from the fact that:\n(a) Phase A smoothing converges to the PL surface on the boundary of B_delta(v) (from Step 2).\n(b) Phase B smoothing converges to the PL surface on the inner boundary of the edge tubular neighborhood.\n(c) The two regions overlap in a zone where both are close to the PL surface.\n\nSUPREMUM OVER ALL SINGULARITIES. The global Hausdorff distance is:\n\n  d_H(K_t, K) = sup{ d_H(K_t cap U_i, K cap U_i) : i in {vertices} cup {edges} },\n\nwhere {U_i} is a covering of K by vertex balls and edge tubular neighborhoods. Since each local Hausdorff distance goes to 0 as t -\u003e 0, and the covering is locally finite (only finitely many singularities in any compact set), the supremum also goes to 0:\n\n  d_H(K_t, K) -\u003e 0   as t -\u003e 0.\n\nSTEP 5 (HAMILTONIAN CONVERGENCE).\n\nFrom Node 1.3, Step 8, the vertex Hamiltonian is:\n\n  H_v(X,Y) = (d/dt)G_t(X) = chi'(|X|/epsilon(t)) * (-|X|*epsilon'(t)/epsilon(t)^2) * F_angular(X).\n\nThis is supported on {epsilon(t) \u003c= |X| \u003c= 2*epsilon(t)}, an annulus shrinking to {0} as t -\u003e 0.\n\nC^0 NORM ESTIMATE. On the support region:\n\n  |H_v| \u003c= C * |chi'| * (epsilon'(t)/epsilon(t)^2) * epsilon(t)^2 = C * epsilon'(t),\n\nwhere we used |F_angular(X)| = O(|X|^2) = O(epsilon(t)^2) on the support.\n\nSince epsilon(t) = (delta/8)*tau(t) and tau is smooth with tau(0) = 0, tau'(0) = 0, we have epsilon'(t) = (delta/8)*tau'(t) -\u003e 0 as t -\u003e 0. Therefore:\n\n  ||H_v||_{C^0} = O(epsilon'(t)) -\u003e 0   as t -\u003e 0.\n\nEDGE HAMILTONIANS. The edge isotopy Hamiltonian H_e depends only on the transverse coordinates (x_2, y_2) and is supported in the region where gamma_t differs from gamma_0. As the rounding radius goes to zero, the support shrinks and the Hamiltonian converges to 0 in C^0:\n\n  ||H_e||_{C^0} -\u003e 0   as t -\u003e 0.\n\nGLOBAL HAMILTONIAN. The global Hamiltonian H_t = sum_v H_v + sum_e H_e (with smooth time reparametrization for concatenation, per Node 1.6, Step 2) satisfies:\n\n  ||H_t||_{C^0} -\u003e 0   as t -\u003e 0.\n\nDIFFEOMORPHISM CONVERGENCE. The Hamiltonian diffeomorphism phi_t generated by H_t satisfies:\n\n  phi_t = id + integral_0^t X_{H_s} ds,\n\nwhere X_{H_s} is the Hamiltonian vector field. Since ||X_{H_s}|| = O(||H_s||_{C^1}) = O(epsilon(s)) and the integral_0^t epsilon(s) ds = O(tau(t)) (since epsilon(t) = (delta/8)*tau(t) and tau is sublinear near 0 due to flatness), we have:\n\n  ||phi_t - id||_{C^0} = O(tau(t)) -\u003e 0   as t -\u003e 0.\n\nAlternatively, using the Gronwall estimate and the fact that H_t -\u003e 0 uniformly on compact sets:\n\n  ||phi_t - id||_{C^0} \u003c= C * integral_0^t ||H_s|| ds -\u003e 0.\n\nSTEP 6 (TOPOLOGICAL ISOTOPY ON [0,1]).\n\nDefine K_0 = K (the original polyhedral Lagrangian surface). For t in (0,1], K_t = phi_t(K) is the smooth Lagrangian from the Hamiltonian isotopy.\n\nCONTINUITY AT t=0. From Step 4, d_H(K_t, K) -\u003e 0 as t -\u003e 0. This means:\n\n(a) For every delta \u003e 0, there exists t_0 \u003e 0 such that K_t subset N_delta(K) and K subset N_delta(K_t) for all t in (0, t_0), where N_delta(L) = {p in R^4 : d(p, L) \u003c delta} is the delta-neighborhood.\n\n(b) The map [0,1] -\u003e {closed subsets of R^4}, t -\u003e K_t, is continuous at t=0 in the Hausdorff topology.\n\nTOPOLOGICAL EXTENSION. The Hamiltonian isotopy K_t for t in (0,1] extends to a topological isotopy on [0,1] by setting K_0 = K. The map t -\u003e K_t is continuous for all t in [0,1], providing the required topological isotopy with K_0 = K and K_1 smooth Lagrangian.\n\nREMARK ON SMOOTHNESS AT t=0. The surfaces K_t are smooth Lagrangian submanifolds for t in (0,1], but K_0 = K is piecewise-linear (NOT smooth). The isotopy is continuous in the Hausdorff topology but is NOT a smooth family of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds on the closed interval [0,1]. This is precisely the content of the problem statement: we construct a Hamiltonian isotopy of smooth Lagrangians for t in (0,1], extending to a topological isotopy on [0,1] with the singular surface K at t=0.\n\nSTEP 7 (SUMMARY AND KEY MECHANISMS).\n\nThe topological extension to t=0 is achieved by three convergence mechanisms:\n\n(1) VERTEX GENERATING FUNCTION CONVERGENCE (Node 1.3 two-zone construction): The smooth generating function G_t = chi(|X|/epsilon(t)) * F_angular(X) converges pointwise to F_PL as epsilon(t) -\u003e 0. The deviation |dG_t - dF_PL| is O(epsilon(t)) on the shrinking transition zone {|X| \u003c= 2*epsilon(t)}, giving Hausdorff convergence Graph(dG_t) -\u003e Graph(dF_PL).\n\n(2) EDGE PROFILE CONVERGENCE (Node 1.4 constant-profile construction): The smooth profile gamma_t in the (x_2, y_2)-plane converges uniformly to the V-shaped profile gamma_0 as the rounding radius goes to zero.\n\n(3) HAMILTONIAN CONVERGENCE TO ZERO: The generating Hamiltonian H_t satisfies ||H_t||_{C^0} -\u003e 0 as t -\u003e 0, ensuring the diffeomorphisms phi_t converge to the identity in C^0. This gives topological continuity of the map t -\u003e phi_t(K) = K_t at t=0, with phi_0 = id and K_0 = K.\n\nThe three mechanisms combine via the global assembly of Node 1.5 to give a single continuous family K_t on [0,1] with K_0 = K (polyhedral singular) and K_t smooth for all t in (0,1].\n\nEND OF PROOF.\n\nWORKED EXAMPLE (STANDARD GAMMA=0 VERTEX).\n\nFor the standard 4-face vertex with gamma=0 (Node 1.2, Node 1.3 example):\n- At t=0.1: epsilon(t) = (delta/8)*tau(0.1) is small but positive. The inner zone {|X| \u003c epsilon(t)} has F_smooth=0 (flat Lagrangian disk). The transition zone {epsilon(t) \u003c= |X| \u003c= 2*epsilon(t)} smoothly interpolates to the angular partition. The outer zone {|X| \u003e 2*epsilon(t)} has F_smooth = F_angular = F_PL (the original PL surface).\n- As t -\u003e 0: epsilon(t) -\u003e 0. The flat inner disk shrinks to a point. The transition zone shrinks to a point. The outer zone (F_smooth = F_PL) expands to cover all of R^2 \\ {0}. The smooth surface L_t approaches the PL surface K in the Hausdorff topology.\n- At t=0: K_0 = K (the polyhedral cone with 4 faces meeting at the origin).\n\nSimilarly for edges: the smooth rounding converges to the sharp V-edge as the rounding parameter goes to zero.\n\nThe global surface K_t is smooth for t \u003e 0 and converges continuously to the polyhedral surface K as t -\u003e 0.","owner":"prover-1.7"}
