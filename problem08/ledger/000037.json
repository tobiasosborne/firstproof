The standard Moser trick interpolates between two NON-DEGENERATE symplectic forms on a manifold. The Lagrangian condition requires the pullback of omega to be ZERO (maximally degenerate). One cannot use the Moser trick to deform a non-degenerate 2-form on K_mollified to the zero 2-form, because the interpolation omega_t = (1-t)*omega|_{K_mollified} + t*0 = (1-t)*omega|_{K_mollified} is non-degenerate only for t \u003c 1 and degenerates at t = 1, violating the non-degeneracy hypothesis of the Moser argument. The correct tool for finding a nearby Lagrangian to a nearly-Lagrangian surface is the Weinstein Lagrangian neighborhood theorem or an explicit graph deformation argument, NOT the Moser trick. Moreover, as shown in a separate challenge, the issue is moot because the explicit coordinate computation shows the mollified surface is already Lagrangian — but the Moser argument as STATED is mathematically incorrect regardless. The phrasing 'Moser-type correction' applied to restore omega|_L = 0 is a category error: Moser corrects between non-degenerate forms, while the Lagrangian condition is a degeneracy condition.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
