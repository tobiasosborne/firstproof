The node claims 'In both cases the surgery is generated by a compactly supported Hamiltonian.' For the tropical resolution case, this claim is entirely unsubstantiated. (1) The Matessi-Mikhalkin construction produces a Lagrangian submanifold, not a Lagrangian isotopy. There is no a priori reason why the smooth Lagrangian produced by the pair-of-pants construction should be Hamiltonian isotopic to the original polyhedral cone. The construction is an EXISTENCE result for a smooth Lagrangian near the singular one, not a deformation result. (2) Even if we could find a Lagrangian isotopy from the polyhedral cone to the smooth Lagrangian, upgrading from Lagrangian to Hamiltonian isotopy requires the flux to vanish. While H^1(R^4;R)=0 handles this globally, the LOCAL compact-support claim requires showing the isotopy can be achieved by a compactly supported Hamiltonian flow, which is a stronger statement. (3) The claim should be: 'There exists a smooth Lagrangian L_smooth that agrees with K outside B_delta(v), and there exists a compactly supported Hamiltonian H such that the time-1 map of X_H carries K to a surface that is smooth near v.' But this requires CONSTRUCTING the Hamiltonian, which is not done.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
