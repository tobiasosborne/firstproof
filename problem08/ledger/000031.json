Banyaga's original theorem (1978) addresses compact symplectic manifolds. For compactly supported diffeomorphisms on non-compact manifolds like R^4, the standard reference is typically McDuff-Salamon (Introduction to Symplectic Topology, Theorem 10.2.5 in 3rd edition) or Polterovich (The Geometry of the Group of Symplectic Diffeomorphisms). The result used here — that Symp_0^c(R^4) = Ham^c(R^4) because H^1(R^4;R) = 0 — is a direct consequence of the flux framework but the attribution should cite a reference that explicitly covers the non-compact compactly-supported case.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
