Coordinates (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) on R^4, identified with standard basis vectors e_1 = (1,0,0,0), e_2 = (0,1,0,0), e_3 = (0,0,1,0), e_4 = (0,0,0,1). The standard symplectic form is omega = dx_1 ^ dy_1 + dx_2 ^ dy_2, equivalently omega(e_1, e_3) = 1, omega(e_2, e_4) = 1, and all other basis pairings vanish. A 2-plane Pi in R^4 is Lagrangian if omega|_Pi = 0. The Lagrangian Grassmannian LG(2,4) parametrizes all such planes.\n\nWARNING ON COORDINATE CONVENTION. Under the alternative convention (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) with basis ordering e_1 = x_1, e_2 = y_1, e_3 = x_2, e_4 = y_2, the symplectic form pairs the first two basis vectors nontrivially: omega(e_1, e_2) = 1. In THAT convention, span{e_1, e_2} would NOT be Lagrangian. All formulas in this node and its dependents use the convention (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) stated above.\n\nSTATEMENT (Lemma 1.2). Let K be a polyhedral Lagrangian surface in (R^4, omega_std) that is a topological submanifold, with exactly 4 faces meeting at each vertex. Let v be any vertex of K. Then:\n\n(a) TANGENT CONE STRUCTURE. The tangent cone TC_v(K) consists of 4 Lagrangian conic sectors S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4 (cyclically ordered). Each sector S_i is a 2-dimensional cone (bounded by two edge rays from v) contained in a Lagrangian plane Pi_i. The 4 edge rays are the pairwise intersections of consecutive planes: ell_{i,i+1} = Pi_i cap Pi_{i+1} (indices mod 4). Consecutive planes share exactly a line.\n\n(b) TYPE B IS IMPOSSIBLE. All 4 Lagrangian planes Pi_1, Pi_2, Pi_3, Pi_4 are pairwise distinct, and non-consecutive planes are transverse: Pi_1 cap Pi_3 = {0} and Pi_2 cap Pi_4 = {0}. The \"Type B\" configuration (opposite sectors coplanar) cannot occur at vertices of a topological submanifold.\n\n(c) TOPOLOGICAL DISK. The link of v in S^3 = partial B_epsilon(v) is a simple closed curve composed of 4 great circle arcs. The tangent cone TC_v(K) is homeomorphic to a closed disk D^2.\n\n(d) Sp(4,R) NORMAL FORM. All Type A vertex configurations are Sp(4,R)-equivalent. After applying a symplectomorphism, the 4 Lagrangian planes take the standard form:\n  Pi_1 = span{e_1, e_2},  Pi_2 = span{e_1, e_4},\n  Pi_3 = span{e_3, e_4},  Pi_4 = span{e_2, e_3},\nwith edge rays ell_{12} = R*e_1, ell_{23} = R*e_4, ell_{34} = R*e_3, ell_{41} = R*e_2. The moduli space of Type A configurations under Sp(4,R) is a single point (0-dimensional).\n\nRemark on the 1-parameter family. In a partial normalization fixing only Pi_1, Pi_2, ell_{12}, and ell_{41}, the configuration depends on a parameter gamma:\n  Pi_3 = span{e_4, gamma*e_1 + e_3},  Pi_4 = span{e_2, gamma*e_1 + e_3}.\nHowever, the symplectomorphism g defined by g(e_3) = e_3 - gamma*e_1 (identity on e_1, e_2, e_4) sends C(gamma) to C(0). So gamma is NOT an invariant; it is an artifact of the incomplete normalization. Node 1.3 may use the C(gamma) form for computational convenience (the explicit construction works for all gamma and the smoothing is equivariant under the symplectomorphism g), but all such configurations are equivalent.\n\n(e) LAGRANGIAN GRASSMANNIAN. LG(2,4) is diffeomorphic to U(2)/O(2), a compact 3-manifold with pi_1(LG(2,4)) = Z.\n\nPROOF.\n\nSTEP 1 (TANGENT CONE STRUCTURE). Translate v to the origin. Since K is polyhedral with 4 faces meeting at v, the tangent cone TC_0(K) is the union of 4 conic sectors S_1, ..., S_4. Each S_i lies in the Lagrangian plane Pi_i tangent to the corresponding face at v (well-defined since each face is a flat Lagrangian polygon). Each S_i is bounded by two edge rays from the origin.\n\nConsecutive faces F_i and F_{i+1} share an edge, so Pi_i and Pi_{i+1} share the direction along that edge: dim(Pi_i cap Pi_{i+1}) \u003e= 1. Since Pi_i and Pi_{i+1} are tangent planes to distinct faces meeting along an edge (not coinciding), they are distinct 2-planes, so their intersection is exactly 1-dimensional: dim(Pi_i cap Pi_{i+1}) = 1 for all consecutive i (mod 4). The shared edge ray is ell_{i,i+1} = Pi_i cap Pi_{i+1}, and S_i is the cone in Pi_i bounded by ell_{i-1,i} and ell_{i,i+1}. This proves part (a).\n\nSTEP 2 (TYPE B IMPOSSIBLE). We prove dim(Pi_1 cap Pi_3) = 0 (and symmetrically dim(Pi_2 cap Pi_4) = 0).\n\nCase dim(Pi_1 cap Pi_3) = 2: Then Pi_1 = Pi_3. The consecutive intersections ell_{12} = Pi_1 cap Pi_2 and ell_{23} = Pi_2 cap Pi_3 = Pi_2 cap Pi_1 are both equal to Pi_1 cap Pi_2, so ell_{12} = ell_{23}. Similarly ell_{34} = ell_{41}. Only 2 distinct edge rays exist. The tangent cone is the union of two planes sharing a line, whose link in S^3 is two great circles meeting at 2 points (a figure-eight). This is not S^1, contradicting the topological manifold hypothesis.\n\nCase dim(Pi_1 cap Pi_3) = 1: Let ell = Pi_1 cap Pi_3 (a line). Since Pi_1 and Pi_3 are both Lagrangian and both contain ell, every u in ell satisfies omega(u, w) = 0 for all w in Pi_1 + Pi_3. Since dim(Pi_1 + Pi_3) = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3, we have ell = (Pi_1 + Pi_3)^omega (the 1-dimensional symplectic complement).\n\nKEY CONSEQUENCE: All 4 edge rays lie in V := Pi_1 + Pi_3 (3-dimensional). Indeed, ell_{12}, ell_{41} lie in Pi_1 subset V and ell_{23}, ell_{34} lie in Pi_3 subset V.\n\nWe now show every Lagrangian plane contained in V must contain ell. Let Pi be Lagrangian with Pi subset V. The restriction omega|_V has radical rad(omega|_V) = V^omega = ell (1-dimensional). Project pi: V -\u003e V/ell (2-dimensional, with nondegenerate induced symplectic form omega_bar). The image pi(Pi) is isotropic in (V/ell, omega_bar). Since V/ell is 2-dimensional symplectic, its maximal isotropic subspaces are 1-dimensional. Since dim(pi(Pi)) \u003c= 1 and dim(Pi) = 2, we get dim(Pi cap ell) \u003e= 1, hence ell subset Pi.\n\nApplying this to Pi_2 and Pi_4 (both Lagrangian and contained in V, since Pi_2 = span{ell_{12}, ell_{23}} subset V and Pi_4 = span{ell_{34}, ell_{41}} subset V): ell subset Pi_i for all i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Then every consecutive intersection Pi_i cap Pi_{i+1} contains ell, forcing all edge rays to equal ell. This contradicts the requirement of 4 distinct faces (which need 4 distinct edge rays).\n\nConclusion: dim(Pi_1 cap Pi_3) = 0. By the identical argument for {Pi_2, Pi_4}: dim(Pi_2 cap Pi_4) = 0. This proves part (b).\n\nSTEP 3 (TOPOLOGICAL DISK). The link L = TC_0(K) cap S^3 is the union of 4 arcs: alpha_i = S_i cap S^3 (a great circle arc in Pi_i cap S^3 from ell_{i-1,i} to ell_{i,i+1}), for i = 1, ..., 4. These arcs share endpoints cyclically: alpha_i ends where alpha_{i+1} begins.\n\nNon-adjacent arcs are disjoint: alpha_1 lies in Pi_1 cap S^3 and alpha_3 lies in Pi_3 cap S^3. Since Pi_1 cap Pi_3 = {0} (Step 2), the great circles Pi_1 cap S^3 and Pi_3 cap S^3 are disjoint (any common point p would satisfy p in Pi_1 cap Pi_3 cap S^3, but Pi_1 cap Pi_3 = {0} and 0 not in S^3). So alpha_1 and alpha_3 are disjoint. Similarly alpha_2 and alpha_4 are disjoint (since Pi_2 cap Pi_4 = {0}).\n\nAdjacent arcs share exactly one endpoint: alpha_i and alpha_{i+1} meet at the unit vector in ell_{i,i+1} and at no other point (they lie on different great circles Pi_i cap S^3 and Pi_{i+1} cap S^3, which intersect in at most 2 antipodal points on S^3; the intersection Pi_i cap Pi_{i+1} = ell_{i,i+1} gives exactly 2 antipodal points on S^3, and each arc occupies less than a semicircle, so they share exactly one of the two antipodal points).\n\nTherefore L is a simple closed curve: 4 arcs joined end-to-end with no self-intersections. The cone on L (union of rays from 0 through L) is homeomorphic to the cone on S^1, which is D^2. This proves part (c).\n\nSTEP 4 (Sp(4,R) NORMAL FORM). We derive the unique normal form.\n\nSub-step 4a. Since Pi_1 and Pi_3 are transverse Lagrangian planes with R^4 = Pi_1 oplus Pi_3, choose dual bases {a_1, a_2} of Pi_1 and {b_1, b_2} of Pi_3 with omega(a_i, b_j) = delta_{ij}. Setting e_1 = a_1, e_2 = a_2, e_3 = b_1, e_4 = b_2 gives a Darboux basis with Pi_1 = span{e_1, e_2} and Pi_3 = span{e_3, e_4}.\n\nSub-step 4b. The stabilizer of (Pi_1, Pi_3) in Sp(4,R) acts as GL(2,R) on Pi_1 (via A -\u003e diag(A, (A^T)^{-1})). The edge ell_{12} is a line in Pi_1; use GL(2,R) to send ell_{12} to R*e_1. The residual stabilizer (preserving R*e_1 in Pi_1) consists of A = [[lambda, mu], [0, nu]] (upper triangular), and the transformation e_2 -\u003e mu*e_1 + nu*e_2 can be used to send ell_{41} (a line in Pi_1 distinct from R*e_1) to R*e_2 (by choosing mu and nu appropriately). After this: ell_{12} = R*e_1 and ell_{41} = R*e_2.\n\nSub-step 4c. Pi_2 contains ell_{12} = R*e_1 and ell_{23} (a line in Pi_3). The Lagrangian condition forces Pi_2 = span{e_1, alpha*e_1 + e_4} for some alpha (derivation: the second basis vector u of Pi_2 must satisfy omega(e_1, u) = 0, so the e_3-component of u vanishes; the e_2-component also vanishes because dim(Pi_2 cap Pi_3) = 1 forces it; see detailed computation below). The remaining parabolic B-freedom (symmetric shear e_3 -\u003e e_3 + B_{11}*e_1, e_4 -\u003e e_4 + B_{12}*e_1) can absorb alpha: after the shear, Pi_2 = span{e_1, e_4}. So ell_{23} = R*e_4.\n\nDetailed computation for Pi_2: Pi_2 = span{e_1, a*e_1 + b*e_2 + c*e_3 + d*e_4}. Lagrangian: omega(e_1, second vector) = c = 0. For ell_{23} = Pi_2 cap Pi_3: vectors s*e_1 + t*(a*e_1 + b*e_2 + d*e_4) in Pi_3 = span{e_3, e_4} require s + ta = 0 and tb = 0. If b != 0 then t = 0, s = 0, contradicting dim = 1. So b = 0. Then Pi_2 = span{e_1, a*e_1 + d*e_4} = span{e_1, e_4} (after absorbing a*e_1 and normalizing d = 1).\n\nSub-step 4d. Now ell_{34} is a line in Pi_3 = span{e_3, e_4} distinct from ell_{23} = R*e_4, so ell_{34} = R*(e_3 + mu*e_4). And ell_{41} = R*e_2 is in Pi_4. Pi_4 = span{e_2, e_3 + mu*e_4}. Lagrangian: omega(e_2, e_3 + mu*e_4) = omega(e_2, e_3) + mu*omega(e_2, e_4) = 0 + mu = mu. So mu = 0, giving ell_{34} = R*e_3 and Pi_4 = span{e_2, e_3}.\n\nSub-step 4e. Residual freedom: after all normalizations, the remaining Sp(4,R) elements preserving (Pi_1, Pi_3, R*e_1, R*e_2, Pi_2, R*e_4) are diag(lambda, nu, 1/lambda, 1/nu). These preserve the entire configuration. So the configuration is fully determined:\n\n  Pi_1 = span{e_1, e_2}, Pi_2 = span{e_1, e_4}, Pi_3 = span{e_3, e_4}, Pi_4 = span{e_2, e_3}.\n  Edges: R*e_1, R*e_4, R*e_3, R*e_2.\n\nThis is the UNIQUE Sp(4,R)-normal form. The moduli space is 0-dimensional (a single orbit).\n\nRemark (C(gamma) family). In the partial normalization fixing Pi_1 = span{e_1, e_2}, ell_{12} = R*e_1, ell_{41} = R*e_2, Pi_2 = span{e_1, e_4} (but NOT normalizing Pi_3 further), the general form is Pi_3 = span{e_4, gamma*e_1 + e_3}, Pi_4 = span{e_2, gamma*e_1 + e_3}, depending on gamma in R. The symplectomorphism g: e_1 -\u003e e_1, e_2 -\u003e e_2, e_3 -\u003e e_3 - gamma*e_1, e_4 -\u003e e_4 sends C(gamma) to C(0). (Proof that g in Sp(4,R): omega(g(e_1), g(e_3)) = omega(e_1, e_3 - gamma*e_1) = 1, omega(g(e_2), g(e_4)) = omega(e_2, e_4) = 1, all other pairings vanish. Also: g(Pi_3(gamma)) = span{e_4, gamma*e_1 + e_3 - gamma*e_1} = span{e_4, e_3} = Pi_3(0), g(Pi_4(gamma)) = span{e_2, gamma*e_1 + e_3 - gamma*e_1} = span{e_2, e_3} = Pi_4(0), and g fixes Pi_1, Pi_2.) Node 1.3 uses the C(gamma) form for constructive flexibility (the generating-function construction works uniformly for all gamma), but the reader should note all such configurations are equivalent.\n\nSTEP 5 (LAGRANGIAN GRASSMANNIAN). The identification LG(n, 2n) = U(n)/O(n) is classical. Identify R^{2n} = C^n via z_j = x_j + i*y_j with omega = Im(sum dz_j wedge d bar{z}_j)/2. The unitary group U(n) preserves omega and acts transitively on Lagrangian n-planes (any Lagrangian plane has an orthonormal basis that extends to a unitary basis of C^n). The stabilizer of the standard Lagrangian plane R^n = {y = 0} in U(n) is O(n). Hence LG(n, 2n) = U(n)/O(n).\n\nFor n = 2: LG(2,4) = U(2)/O(2). This is a compact manifold of real dimension dim U(2) - dim O(2) = 4 - 1 = 3.\n\nFundamental group: from the long exact sequence of the fibration O(2) -\u003e U(2) -\u003e U(2)/O(2):\n  pi_1(O(2)) -\u003e pi_1(U(2)) -\u003e pi_1(LG(2,4)) -\u003e pi_0(O(2)) -\u003e pi_0(U(2)).\n\npi_1(O(2)) = Z (generated by a loop in SO(2) = S^1). pi_1(U(2)) = Z (via det: U(2) -\u003e U(1)). pi_0(O(2)) = Z/2. pi_0(U(2)) = 0.\n\nThe map pi_1(O(2)) -\u003e pi_1(U(2)): the generator of pi_1(SO(2)) is gamma(t) = diag(e^{it}, 1) for t in [0, 2pi]. Under inclusion SO(2) -\u003e U(2): gamma(t) has det = e^{it}, which represents the generator of pi_1(U(1)) = Z under the det map. Wait: SO(2) embeds into U(2) as 2x2 real rotation matrices [[cos t, -sin t],[sin t, cos t]], which have det = 1 (as complex matrices), so the loop maps to the TRIVIAL element in pi_1(U(2)).\n\nMore carefully: the standard embedding O(2) -\u003e U(2) sends a real orthogonal matrix A to the same matrix viewed as a unitary matrix. The generator of pi_1(SO(2)) is A(t) = [[cos t, -sin t],[sin t, cos t]] (t in [0, 2pi]). As a unitary matrix, det(A(t)) = cos^2(t) + sin^2(t) = 1. So the loop has constant determinant 1 and lies in SU(2). Since pi_1(SU(2)) = 0 (SU(2) = S^3), this loop is contractible in U(2). The map pi_1(O(2)) -\u003e pi_1(U(2)) is the zero map.\n\nThe exact sequence becomes: 0 -\u003e pi_1(U(2)) -\u003e pi_1(LG(2,4)) -\u003e pi_0(O(2)) -\u003e 0, i.e., 0 -\u003e Z -\u003e pi_1(LG(2,4)) -\u003e Z/2 -\u003e 0. This is an extension of Z/2 by Z. The extension is determined by the connecting homomorphism in the long exact sequence, which identifies pi_1(LG(2,4)) = Z (the nontrivial extension, corresponding to the index-2 subgroup 2Z in Z with quotient Z/2). Concretely, the generator of pi_1(LG(2,4)) maps to the nontrivial element of pi_0(O(2)) (i.e., its square maps to the generator of the Z subgroup). This gives pi_1(LG(2,4)) = Z.\n\n(Reference: McDuff-Salamon, \"Introduction to Symplectic Topology,\" Section 2.1; or Guillemin-Sternberg, \"Symplectic Techniques in Physics.\")\n\nThis proves part (e).\n\nEND OF PROOF.\n\nSUMMARY.
