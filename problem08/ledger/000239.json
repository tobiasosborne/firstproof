K necessarily has a Lagrangian smoothing.\n\nPROOF STRATEGY. The proof proceeds in seven major steps:\n\nSTEP 1 (VERTEX CLASSIFICATION). Node 1.2 (VALIDATED) classifies all vertices. Every vertex where exactly 4 faces meet in a polyhedral Lagrangian surface is Type A: the 4 Lagrangian planes Pi_1, Pi_2, Pi_3, Pi_4 satisfy (i) each pair of consecutive planes shares a line (edge), (ii) each pair of non-consecutive planes is transverse. Moreover, all Type A vertices are Sp(4,R)-equivalent to a standard normal form depending on a single real parameter gamma in R. By reduction, gamma can be eliminated (all vertices equivalent to gamma=0). No Type B vertices (opposite half-planes coplanar) can occur at vertices of a topological surface.\n\nSTEP 2 (LOCAL VERTEX SMOOTHING). Node 1.3 (PENDING) constructs a smooth Lagrangian disk L_v in each vertex ball B_delta(v), generated by a compactly supported Hamiltonian isotopy. The construction uses cotangent generating functions with a two-zone design: (i) Inner zone (|X| \u003c epsilon): F_smooth = 0, giving a flat Lagrangian plane (the zero section of T*R^2). (ii) Outer zone (epsilon \u003c= |X| \u003c= delta): Angular interpolation F_angular using a smooth partition of unity on S^1, multiplied by a radial cutoff chi(|X|/epsilon) that is flat at |X| = epsilon. The generating function is globally C^infinity on the base disk, including at the origin (D^2F_smooth(0) = 0, a well-defined zero matrix). The Hamiltonian isotopy is a shrinking inner-zone family: start with epsilon = 0 (surface = K, piecewise linear) and expand to epsilon = delta/8 (surface = L_v, smooth), using a flat reparametrization tau(t) to ensure smooth extension of the Hamiltonian to t = 0. Compact support: supp(H_v) subset B_delta(v).\n\nSTEP 3 (EDGE SMOOTHING). Node 1.4 (VALIDATED) smooths V-shaped edge singularities via product Lagrangian construction. In edge-adapted coordinates (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) where the edge is the x_1-axis and the two adjacent Lagrangian faces lie in {y_1 = 0}, the V-shaped edge has profile gamma_0(s) = (x_2(s), y_2(s)) (two rays in the transverse plane). Replace gamma_0 with a smooth curve gamma_1 having the same endpoints at infinity. The smoothed edge is L_e = {(x_1, gamma_1(s), 0, gamma_2(s)) : (x_1,s) in R x R}, a product of R (along x_1) and the curve (gamma_1(s), 0, gamma_2(s)) in the (x_2, y_1, y_2)-space. This is automatically Lagrangian: omega pulls back to 0 because dy_1 = 0 identically and dx_2, dy_2 depend only on the single parameter s (iota*(dx_2 ^ dy_2) = 0). The profile is constant (x_1-independent), avoiding cross-term issues. The construction is generated by a Hamiltonian supported in a tubular neighborhood of the edge.\n\nSTEP 4 (GLOBAL ASSEMBLY). Node 1.5 (PENDING) combines vertex and edge smoothings into a smooth embedded Lagrangian surface L via a two-phase Hamiltonian isotopy. Phase A (vertices): For each vertex v_i, choose radius delta_i small enough that the vertex balls B_{delta_i}(v_i) are pairwise disjoint. Apply Node 1.3's construction simultaneously at all vertices. The combined Hamiltonian H_A = sum_i H_{v_i} has pairwise disjoint supports, so Poisson brackets vanish and the flows commute. Output: K_A = phi_1^{H_A}(K), smooth inside each vertex ball and equal to K outside. Phase B (edges): For each edge e_k, apply Node 1.4's construction to the portion of the edge outside all vertex balls (the edge exterior e_k^o). Choose tubular neighborhood radii epsilon_k such that the edge tubes are pairwise disjoint. The combined Hamiltonian H_B = sum_k H_{e_k} again has pairwise disjoint supports. Output: L = phi_1^{H_B}(K_A), smooth everywhere. Sequential composition: phi_t^{total} = phi_{2t}^{H_A} for t in [0,1/2], then phi_t^{total} = phi_{2t-1}^{H_B} o phi_1^{H_A} for t in [1/2,1]. Phases A and B are sequential (not simultaneous) because their supports overlap in transition zones near vertex ball boundaries. Compact support: supp(H_A) cup supp(H_B) is contained in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the 1-skeleton of K.\n\nBoundary matching (key technical point): At the junction between Phase A and Phase B (the boundary of vertex balls along edges), Phase A produces a smooth surface. Phase B acts on this already-smooth surface, extending the smoothing further along the edge. No mismatch occurs because Phase A's generating function construction extends slightly beyond the vertex ball to smooth the edge creases approaching the vertex, ensuring the surface is smooth at the junction radius. The edge-adapted coordinates from Node 1.4 are compatible with the cotangent graph coordinates from Node 1.3 in the overlap region (both describe the same Lagrangian surface using different local charts).\n\nSTEP 5 (HAMILTONIAN ISOTOPY VERIFICATION). Node 1.6 (PENDING) verifies that the isotopy K_t from K to L is Hamiltonian throughout. Phase A is Hamiltonian by construction (Node 1.3's generating function isotopy, with explicit time-dependent Hamiltonian H_t(X,Y) = (d/dt)G_t(X) where G_t is the family of generating functions). Phase B is Hamiltonian (Node 1.4's edge profile deformation, with H(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2) constructed via the Lagrangian graph isotopy). Concatenation of Hamiltonian isotopies is Hamiltonian (using a smooth time reparametrization to join the two phases). The total flow phi_t^{total} for t in [0,1] is a Hamiltonian isotopy in the ambient symplectic manifold (R^4, omega_std).\n\nSTEP 6 (TOPOLOGICAL EXTENSION TO t=0). Node 1.7 (PENDING) extends the smooth Hamiltonian isotopy {K_t}_{t in (0,1]} to a continuous family on [0,1] with K_0 = K. The key argument is uniform convergence: as t -\u003e 0, the smoothing parameters shrink (vertex inner zone radius epsilon(t) -\u003e 0, edge smoothing profile amplitude -\u003e 0), and the smooth surfaces K_t converge uniformly on compact sets to the piecewise-linear surface K. The convergence is in the C^0 topology (Hausdorff distance on compact subsets), not C^1 (the derivatives blow up at the creases). The limiting surface K_0 = lim_{t-\u003e0} K_t is the original polyhedral surface K. This gives a topological isotopy on [0,1].\n\nSTEP 7 (OBSTRUCTION ANALYSIS). Node 1.8 (PENDING) verifies that no global obstructions prevent the smoothing. (a) Maslov class: The Maslov class is a homotopy invariant, so Mas(L) = Mas(K). Polyhedral Lagrangians have well-defined Maslov class (computed from face normals), and the Lagrangian isotopy preserves this class. (b) Floer homology: R^4 is convex at infinity, so Floer theory is well-behaved. The Lagrangian smoothing does not introduce new topology (L and K are isotopic, hence diffeomorphic as abstract surfaces). (c) Topological constraints: The surface K is a topological submanifold (link at each vertex is a simple closed curve for Type A vertices), so smoothing is topologically possible. (d) Monodromy: The local normal form at each vertex is unique up to symplectomorphism, so there is no monodromy obstruction to patching local smoothings.\n\nDEPENDENCIES.
