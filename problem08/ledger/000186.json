A Lagrangian isotopy in the standard sense requires all L_t to be smooth Lagrangian submanifolds. What is true is: {L_t}_{t in (0,1]} is a smooth family of smooth embedded Lagrangian surfaces, and L_t -\u003e L_0 = K in the Hausdorff topology as t -\u003e 0. The Hamiltonian isotopy claim is valid for t in (0,1], which is what the overall proof needs (K_t smooth Lagrangian for t in (0,1], topological limit K_0 = K). The proof should state this more precisely to avoid confusion with the standard definition of Lagrangian isotopy.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
