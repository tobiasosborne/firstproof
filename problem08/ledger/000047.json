The systematic analysis shows: consecutive Lagrangian planes must share a line (dim 1 intersection). For non-consecutive pairs, the possible intersection dimensions are 0, 1, or 2. The topological manifold condition (link = simple closed curve) forces the 4 edge rays to be distinct and to span R^4. This in turn forces non-consecutive intersection dimension to be 0 (Type A). But this argument is absent from the claim. The intermediate cases dim(Pi_1 cap Pi_3)=1 or dim(Pi_2 cap Pi_4)=1 are not explicitly ruled out; one must show they are incompatible with 4 distinct edge rays and the Lagrangian condition. This gap must be filled for the classification to be rigorous.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
