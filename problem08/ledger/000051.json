This is technically appropriate since node 1.2 is a foundational classification claim. However, this node is better described as a LEMMA that should be PROVED from the definitions and the topological submanifold hypothesis, rather than assumed. The classification follows from: (i) at a vertex of a polyhedral surface with 4 faces, the tangent cone is 4 sectors in 4 Lagrangian planes, (ii) the topological submanifold condition forces the link to be S^1, (iii) this forces non-consecutive planes to be transverse. Making this a proved lemma rather than an assumption would strengthen the logical structure.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
