The node's verification prompt states Im(z_1 bar{z_2}) = x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2. The correct computation gives: z_1 bar{z_2} = (x_1+iy_1)(x_2-iy_2) = (x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2) + i(y_1 x_2 - x_1 y_2), so Im(z_1 bar{z_2}) = y_1 x_2 - x_1 y_2, not x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2. Since we set it equal to 0, the sign doesn't affect the zero set, but it reflects imprecision in the mathematical formulation.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
