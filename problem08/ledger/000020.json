(1) The Maslov class is defined for smooth Lagrangians as a cohomology class in H^1(L;Z), measuring the winding of the Lagrangian tangent plane in LG(2,4). For a polyhedral Lagrangian, each face has a constant tangent plane, so the Gauss map into LG(2,4)=U(2)/O(2) is indeed piecewise constant. But the 'local Maslov index' at a vertex is not a standard notion — one must define it as the winding number of the Gauss map around the link of the vertex. (2) The claim that this winding is EVEN at 4-valent vertices is stated without proof. For a 4-valent vertex the Gauss map traces a path through 4 points in LG(2,4). The Maslov index of this loop depends on the specific Lagrangian planes. For Type B (two transverse planes traversed twice), the winding is 2*mu(L1,L2) which is even. But for Type A (4 distinct planes), the Maslov index is mu(P1,P2)+mu(P2,P3)+mu(P3,P4)+mu(P4,P1) — why must this sum be even? Each local Maslov index mu(Pi,Pj) for transverse Lagrangian planes in R^4 is in {0,1,2}, and their sum modulo 2 needs explicit verification. (3) 'Compatible with smooth Lagrangian Maslov classes' is vague — it should state that the piecewise-constant Maslov class extends to a well-defined H^1(L;Z) class on the smoothed surface, which requires that the winding at every vertex be even (so the smoothed Gauss map is null-homologous locally). This is the critical implication that is not proved.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
