The claim says the procedure produces 'a global smooth Lagrangian K_t' but never verifies this. After Phase A + Phase B, the surface K_t is constructed by:\n(1) Vertex smoothing inside each B_delta(v) — produces smooth Lagrangian pieces.\n(2) Edge smoothing inside tubular neighborhoods of edges (outside vertex balls) — produces smooth Lagrangian pieces.\n(3) Face interiors — already smooth (flat Lagrangian planes), untouched by either phase.\n\nFor K_t to be a SMOOTH LAGRANGIAN submanifold globally, three things must hold at every point:\n\n(A) SMOOTHNESS AT FACE-EDGE JUNCTIONS: Where the edge smoothing meets the unmodified face interiors. The edge smoothing replaces the V-shaped dihedral angle with a smooth curve. At the boundary of the edge smoothing support, the smooth curve must transition back to the flat V-shape. If the edge smoothing has compact support in the transverse direction, it must flatten out to agree with the original flat faces at the boundary — but a smooth curve that IS flat outside a compact set and non-flat inside is possible (using a bump function profile). The Lagrangian condition is maintained by the product structure (node 1.4 correction). This is OK.\n\n(B) SMOOTHNESS AT VERTEX-EDGE JUNCTIONS: This is the critical gap identified in separate challenge ch-a5c510cf. The vertex smoothing and edge smoothing must match at the boundary of B_delta(v). This is not addressed.\n\n(C) SMOOTHNESS AT VERTEX-FACE JUNCTIONS: Where the vertex-smoothed region meets the unmodified face interiors. Inside B_delta(v), the vertex smoothing changes the surface. Outside B_delta(v), the faces are flat planes. At the boundary of B_delta(v) intersected with a face, the vertex smoothing must transition smoothly to the flat plane. This requires the vertex smoothing (from node 1.3) to have the property that near the boundary of B_delta(v), the smoothed surface agrees with the original flat faces. But the tropical resolution (for Type A vertices) CHANGES THE TOPOLOGY of the surface near v — it introduces a new edge and rearranges the faces. After tropical resolution, the faces near the boundary of B_delta(v) may NOT be the same flat planes as the original faces. The transition from the tropically-resolved surface to the original flat faces requires an explicit construction that is nowhere provided.\n\n(D) EMBEDDEDNESS: The resulting surface must be embedded, not just immersed. The smoothing could introduce self-intersections if:\n- Edge smoothings of parallel edges create overlapping regions.\n- Vertex smoothings extend beyond the vertex ball (which they should not, by compact support, but this needs verification).\n- The tropical resolution introduces self-intersections (the resolved surface has more faces and edges, and the pair-of-pants could self-intersect).\n\nThe node addresses NONE of these completeness conditions. It asserts 'the result is a global smooth Lagrangian K_t' without checking any of the required conditions for global smoothness, embeddedness, or Lagrangian-ness.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
