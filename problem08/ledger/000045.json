This is imprecise terminology. A half-plane is a sector bounded by a single line (opening angle pi). At a 4-valent vertex, each face contributes a SECTOR (2-dimensional cone) bounded by TWO edge rays, with opening angle that can be anything from 0 to pi. In the standard example (Pi_1=span{e1,e2} with edges along e1 and e2), the sector has opening angle pi/2, not pi. The correct term is '4 Lagrangian sectors' or '4 Lagrangian 2-dimensional cones'. While not mathematically wrong (a sector is contained in a half-plane of the ambient Lagrangian plane), it is misleading because it suggests each face fills a full half-plane.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
