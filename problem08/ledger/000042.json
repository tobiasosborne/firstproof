The original polyhedral surface K is an embedded topological submanifold of R^4. The smoothed surface must also be embedded (not merely immersed). The node does not verify that the smooth Lagrangian L_epsilon is embedded. In the adapted coordinates, the constant-profile smoothing {(x_1, 0, gamma(t))} is embedded if and only if gamma is an injective curve (no self-intersections). For the V-to-smooth transition, a convex curve is automatically injective, so embeddedness holds in the edge interior. However, in the cutoff transition regions (where the profile varies with x_1), the argument for embeddedness is less clear and is not provided. More critically, different edges' smoothings must not create new intersections. This is a global concern properly belonging to node 1.5, but node 1.4 should at least state that the local construction is an embedding.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
