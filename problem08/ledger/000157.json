This is the same fallacious inference as in Step 4. D(X) = r^2 * h(theta) where h(theta) is smooth, 2pi-periodic, and vanishes identically on sector interiors (open arcs of the circle). A smooth function that vanishes on open intervals but is nonzero on transition strips is NOT a trigonometric polynomial of bounded degree. The Fourier series of h necessarily contains modes |n| \u003e 2, making r^2*h(theta) non-smooth at origin. Since D fails smoothness at 0, the Hamiltonian H = phi*D (Step 7) is not a smooth function on R^4, the Hamiltonian flow is not well-defined, and the entire construction collapses. This is the same root cause as the F_smooth issue but propagates through the compact-support construction and the isotopy.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
