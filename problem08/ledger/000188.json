This is imprecise. The isotopy velocity field X_t is nonzero on the set {(x_1, gamma_t(s), 0, gamma_{t}(s)) : x_1 in R, |s| \u003c T} ∩ {gamma_t differs from V-shape}. This set is infinite in the x_1-direction (an infinite strip R x K for compact K in the (x_2,y_2)-plane). So neither X_t nor the generating Hamiltonian H_t has compact support in R^4. What IS true is: (1) H_t depends only on (x_2, y_2) and has compact support in the (x_2, y_2)-plane, and (2) the Hamiltonian vector field X_{H_t} vanishes in the x_1 and y_1 directions. For a finite edge segment [a,b] (the actual case after removing vertex balls), the support is compact. The proof should clarify that 'compact support in the transverse directions' is the correct statement, not 'compact support' unqualified. This does not affect the Hamiltonian isotopy conclusion, since the flow is well-defined regardless.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
