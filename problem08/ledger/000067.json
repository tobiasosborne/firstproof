The statement says 'The sequential approach avoids nonlinear patching issues inherent in partitions of unity for the Lagrangian condition.' This conflates two things:\n\n(1) The Lagrangian condition is indeed nonlinear: omega|_L = 0 is a pointwise condition on the tangent planes of L. You cannot take a convex combination of Lagrangian submanifolds and expect the result to be Lagrangian. So partition-of-unity approaches on the SUBMANIFOLD level do not work. This is correct.\n\n(2) However, the construction does NOT use partitions of unity on the submanifold. It uses partitions of unity on the HAMILTONIAN FUNCTION. The Hamiltonian H = chi_1 * H_vertex + chi_2 * H_edge (where chi_i are cutoff functions) is a well-defined smooth function on R^4, and its flow is a well-defined symplectomorphism. The flow of a Hamiltonian always sends Lagrangians to Lagrangians. So one CAN use partitions of unity on the Hamiltonian level, and this is what the construction implicitly does (each local smoothing is a Hamiltonian, and they are summed/composed).\n\nThe claimed advantage of 'sequential approach' is actually about something else: ensuring that each phase STARTS from a well-defined configuration. Phase A starts from the polyhedral surface K. Phase B starts from the output of Phase A (K with smoothed vertices). The sequentiality ensures that Phase B's input is well-characterized. But this is not about 'avoiding partition-of-unity issues' — it is about managing the intermediate state of the construction.\n\nFurthermore, the description says Phase A is 'simultaneous' and Phase B is 'simultaneous.' The only 'sequential' part is that A precedes B. But WHY can't Phase B be done simultaneously with Phase A? If all edge and vertex smoothings have disjoint support, one could sum ALL Hamiltonians (vertex + edge) and apply the combined flow. The answer is that edge smoothings near vertex balls do NOT have disjoint support from vertex smoothings — they overlap at the edge-vertex junction. So the sequentiality is NECESSARY to handle the overlap, not merely convenient. This necessary reason is not stated.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
