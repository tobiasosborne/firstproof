For a function H depending only on X (not Y) in T*R^2, Hamilton's equations give dX/dt = partial_Y H = 0 and dY/dt = -partial_X H = -dH(X). The flow is phi_H^t(X,Y) = (X, Y - t*dH(X)). Applying to a point on K: phi_H^1(X, dF_PL(X)) = (X, dF_PL(X) - d(phi*D)(X)). For this to equal (X, dF_final(X)) = (X, dF_PL(X) + d(phi*D)(X)), we need -d(phi*D) = +d(phi*D), which is false unless D=0. The correct Hamiltonian should be H = -phi*D (negative sign). This is fixable by negating H, so it does not break the existence claim, but the explicit formula in Step 7 is wrong.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
