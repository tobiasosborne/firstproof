The core problem with the assembly is that Phase A (generating functions) and Phase B (product Lagrangians) use fundamentally different Lagrangian constructions that produce surfaces of different geometric type. Phase A produces COTANGENT GRAPH LAGRANGIANS: L_A = {(X, dF(X))} in cotangent coordinates. Phase B produces PRODUCT LAGRANGIANS: L_B = {(x_1, gamma(s), 0, gamma_2(s))} in edge-adapted coordinates. At their shared boundary (the circle |X|=delta+eta on the edge), neither phase is acting. The surface is K (PL with crease). For the FINAL surface L to be smooth at this boundary, one of three things must happen: (1) Phase A extends past the boundary and smooths the crease there — but Phase A has phi=0 there. (2) Phase B extends back to the boundary and smooths the crease there — but Phase B has chi_long=0 there. (3) There is a THIRD mechanism that smooths the crease at the boundary — but none is described. The 'overlap/handoff' described in Step 4 is verbal but mathematically vacuous. The node claims 'Phase B acts on an already-smooth surface' at the junction, but this is false: at the junction, the surface is PL (neither phase has modified it). The correct approach would require the Phase A and Phase B supports to OVERLAP: Phase A smooths slightly past delta, and Phase B starts slightly before delta, with both smoothings agreeing in the overlap region. But ensuring agreement of a cotangent graph Lagrangian and a product Lagrangian in an overlap region is a non-trivial matching problem that is nowhere addressed.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
