Step 1b claims that for a finite edge, the cutoff chi(x_1) 'breaks the product structure and introduces a symplectic error of order O(epsilon * |chi'|)' and invokes the Weinstein Lagrangian neighborhood theorem to produce a correction Hamiltonian H_e^corr. However, this analysis belongs to Node 1.5 (global assembly), not to Node 1.4 (edge smoothing). Node 1.4 explicitly states: 'The construction is explicit and the Lagrangian condition holds exactly (no correction needed).' Node 1.4 uses a CONSTANT profile along the edge (no x_1-dependent cutoff), and proves omega pulls back to zero identically. The x_1-dependent cutoff chi(x_1) is introduced by Node 1.5 (Step 4) to handle the vertex-edge transition, and Node 1.5's approach is NOT to use Weinstein correction but rather to rely on the fact that Phase A already smooths the surface at the junction point, so Phase B deforms an already-smooth surface. Node 1.6 Step 1b is thus inconsistent with both Node 1.4 (which needs no correction) and Node 1.5 (which uses a different matching strategy). The Weinstein correction argument is an artifact of a previous version of the proof. Either: (a) remove the Weinstein correction claim and align with Node 1.4's exact Lagrangian construction + Node 1.5's transition strategy, or (b) provide an independent justification for why the correction is needed despite Node 1.4's exactness claim.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
