For a bounded edge between two vertices, compact support requires introducing a cutoff function along the edge, making the smooth profile x_1-dependent. But this BREAKS the Lagrangian condition: the product structure (line x curve) that guarantees omega|_L = 0 requires the curve profile to be constant along x_1. With a cutoff chi(x_1), the pullback of omega gains a term of order O(epsilon * |chi prime|), which is nonzero in the transition region. FIXING this symplectic error requires a DIFFERENT correction than stated — not a Moser trick (which handles non-degenerate forms) but a Weinstein Lagrangian neighborhood deformation applied to the nearby smooth Lagrangian. For unbounded edges (non-compact K), as already flagged in node 1.6 verification, the smoothing has non-compact support and cannot be generated by a compactly supported Hamiltonian. The node conflates two distinct issues: (1) the edge interior, where the constant-profile smoothing is exactly Lagrangian and no correction is needed, and (2) the transition zones near edge endpoints, where a cutoff breaks the Lagrangian condition and a correction IS needed but via a different mechanism than stated.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
