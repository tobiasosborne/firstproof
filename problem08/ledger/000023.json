This claim has multiple issues. (1) For Type B vertices (Polterovich surgery), the surgery parameter is lambda in (0,infinity), so the parameter space is indeed (0,infinity) which is contractible. There are also TWO topological choices of surgery (connect-sum L1#L2 or L2#L1, corresponding to the sign of lambda), but the topological manifold condition on K determines which choice gives a manifold result. So far so good. (2) For Type A vertices (tropical resolution), the situation is MORE COMPLEX. The tropical resolution involves: (a) choosing a partition of the 4 faces into 2 pairs — there are 3 such partitions ({1,2}|{3,4}, {1,3}|{2,4}, {1,4}|{2,3}), (b) a continuous parameter (the length of the connecting edge). The partitions form a DISCRETE set, not a contractible space. The claim 'product of half-lines' ignores this discrete choice. The full parameter space is the DISJOINT UNION of 3 copies of (0,infinity), which is NOT contractible (it has 3 connected components with pi_0 = Z/3). (3) Even granting contractibility locally, the monodromy argument requires that the LOCAL smoothing choices can be made CONSISTENTLY across all vertices. This is a global combinatorial problem: at each vertex, one must choose a partition that is compatible with the partitions at adjacent vertices (sharing an edge forces constraints on which faces are grouped together). The node does not address this global consistency condition. (4) The phrase 'product of half-lines' suggests each vertex contributes one (0,infinity) factor independently. But if vertices share edges, their smoothing parameters are NOT independent — the smoothed edge must match at both endpoints. This coupling between vertex parameters is ignored. (5) A genuine monodromy obstruction could arise as follows: consider a compact polyhedral torus with vertices v_1,...,v_n arranged cyclically. If the consistent choice of Type A partition at v_i forces a particular partition at v_{i+1}, going around the cycle might force an inconsistency. This is analogous to the obstruction to choosing spin structures on a surface. The node provides no argument ruling this out.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
