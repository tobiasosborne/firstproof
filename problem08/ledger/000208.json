Depends on: Node 1.2 (vertex classification). Inference type: construction.\n\nSTATEMENT (Lemma). Let v be a vertex of the polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in (R^4, omega_std) where 4 faces meet. For every delta \u003e 0 sufficiently small, there exists a smooth embedded Lagrangian disk L_v in B_delta(v) and a compactly supported Hamiltonian H: R^4 -\u003e R with supp(H) subset B_delta(v) such that the time-1 flow phi_H^1 satisfies phi_H^1(K cap B_delta(v)) = L_v. The Lagrangian L_v agrees with K outside an arbitrarily small neighborhood of v.\n\nCONVENTIONS. Coordinates (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) on R^4 with omega = dx_1 ^ dy_1 + dx_2 ^ dy_2. We identify R^4 = T*R^2 with base (x_1, x_2) and fiber (y_1, y_2). Standard fact: the graph {(x, dF(x)) : x in U} of an exact 1-form dF is a Lagrangian submanifold. This is the foundational tool of the construction.\n\nPROOF.\n\nSTEP 1 (VERTEX NORMAL FORM). Translate v to 0. By Node 1.2, only Type A vertices occur: the 4 Lagrangian half-planes lie in 4 pairwise-distinct Lagrangian planes Pi_1, Pi_2, Pi_3, Pi_4 (cyclically ordered), with consecutive planes intersecting in a line (the shared edge) and non-consecutive planes transverse. After Sp(4,R)-normalization, these depend on a single real parameter gamma:\n\n  Pi_1 = span{e_1, e_2},  Pi_2 = span{e_1, e_4},\n  Pi_3 = span{e_4, gamma*e_1 + e_3},  Pi_4 = span{e_2, gamma*e_1 + e_3},\n\nwith shared edges e_{12} = R*e_1, e_{23} = R*e_4, e_{34} = R*(gamma*e_1 + e_3), e_{41} = R*e_2. The tangent cone C_v consists of 4 sectors S_i subset Pi_i forming a topological disk; its link in S^3 is a simple closed curve of 4 great circle arcs.\n\nSTEP 2 (TRANSVERSALITY LEMMA). We require all 4 planes to be simultaneously transverse to a single Lagrangian reference plane Lambda, so that each Pi_i can be written as a cotangent graph.\n\nLemma (Simultaneous transversality). Given k Lagrangian planes Pi_1,...,Pi_k in R^{2n} in general position, there exists a Lagrangian plane Lambda transverse to every Pi_i, provided k \u003c= dim LG(n,2n) = n(n+1)/2 + 1 (which holds for k=4, n=2 since dim LG(2,4) = 3).\n\nProof: The Maslov cycle Sigma(Pi_i) = {Lambda in LG(n,2n) : Lambda cap Pi_i != 0} is a codimension-1 algebraic subvariety of LG(n,2n). For k planes, the union Sigma(Pi_1) cup ... cup Sigma(Pi_k) has codimension 1 in the 3-manifold LG(2,4). The complement is open and dense. Since LG(2,4) is connected (it is U(2)/O(2)), the complement of k codimension-1 subvarieties is nonempty (in fact dense) for any finite k. Hence Lambda exists.\n\nFor the EXPLICIT standard form, we exhibit Lambda directly. Set Lambda = span{e_1 + e_3, e_2 + e_4} when gamma = 0, which is Lagrangian (omega(e_1+e_3, e_2+e_4) = 0) and transverse to all 4 planes (verified by checking that Pi_i + Lambda = R^4 for each i; equivalently, the 4x4 matrix formed by bases of Pi_i and Lambda has nonzero determinant for each i). For general gamma, a smooth family Lambda(gamma) can be chosen (by openness of the transversality condition and connectedness of the parameter space R).\n\nSTEP 3 (COTANGENT GRAPH COORDINATES). Apply the linear symplectomorphism Phi that sends Lambda to the standard fiber F = span{e_3, e_4} and a complementary Lagrangian plane to the base B = span{e_1, e_2}. In the new Darboux coordinates (X_1, X_2, Y_1, Y_2), each Pi_i is transverse to F and hence takes the form:\n\n  Pi_i = {(X, A_i X) : X in R^2},\n\nwhere A_i is a symmetric 2x2 matrix (symmetry is equivalent to the Lagrangian condition for a linear graph). On sector Omega_i in the base (X_1, X_2)-plane, the face of K is the graph of X -\u003e A_i X. The piecewise-linear generating function is:\n\n  F_PL(X) = (1/2) X^T A_i X,  for X in Omega_i.\n\nContinuity: along the shared edge between sectors Omega_i and Omega_{i+1}, the two linear forms dF_i = A_i X and dF_{i+1} = A_{i+1} X agree on the edge direction (because the edge lies in Pi_i cap Pi_{i+1}, so A_i and A_{i+1} give the same fiber value along that direction). Hence F_PL is continuous and piecewise smooth, with creases along the 4 edge projections.\n\nSTEP 3 VERIFICATION (gamma = 0 explicit). For gamma = 0, choosing Lambda = span{e_1+e_3, e_2+e_4}, the symplectomorphism Phi has the following effect on the 4 planes (computed in full in the worked example below):\n\n  A_1 = (1/2)Id,  A_2 = diag(1/2, -1/2),  A_3 = -(1/2)Id,  A_4 = diag(-1/2, 1/2).\n\nThe sectors Omega_1,...,Omega_4 are the four quadrants of the (X_1,X_2)-plane, separated by the axes (which are the projections of the edge rays). The generating functions are F_1 = (X_1^2+X_2^2)/4, F_2 = (X_1^2-X_2^2)/4, F_3 = -(X_1^2+X_2^2)/4, F_4 = (-X_1^2+X_2^2)/4. One verifies: along the positive X_1-axis (edge between Omega_1 and Omega_2), dF_1(X_1,0) = (X_1/2, 0) = dF_2(X_1,0). Along the positive X_2-axis (edge between Omega_1 and Omega_4), dF_1(0,X_2) = (0, X_2/2) = dF_4(0,X_2). The other edges match similarly.\n\nSTEP 4 (SMOOTH GENERATING FUNCTION). Let theta = theta(X) denote the angular coordinate in the base R^2 (measured from the positive X_1-axis). The 4 sectors Omega_i are separated by 4 angular values theta_1 \u003c theta_2 \u003c theta_3 \u003c theta_4 (the angles of the edge projections). Choose a smooth partition of unity {rho_i(theta)}_{i=1}^4 subordinate to slightly enlarged sectors, depending only on theta, with rho_i = 1 on the interior of Omega_i and transition regions of angular width alpha \u003e 0 (which may be chosen arbitrarily small). Define the smooth generating function:\n\n  F_smooth(X) = sum_{i=1}^{4} rho_i(theta(X)) * (1/2) X^T A_i X.\n\nProperties of F_smooth:\n(a) F_smooth is smooth on R^2 setminus {0} (smooth partition of smooth quadratic forms).\n(b) F_smooth is homogeneous of degree 2: F_smooth(lambda X) = lambda^2 F_smooth(X) for lambda \u003e 0. This follows because each (1/2) X^T A_i X is homogeneous of degree 2 and rho_i depends only on theta (not on r = |X|).\n(c) F_smooth extends smoothly to the origin with F_smooth(0) = 0, dF_smooth(0) = 0, and D^2 F_smooth(0) = sum_i rho_i(theta) A_i (which is a smooth function of theta, hence F_smooth is smooth at the origin by homogeneity degree 2).\n(d) In the interior of each sector Omega_i, rho_i = 1 and rho_j = 0 for j != i, so F_smooth = F_i = (1/2) X^T A_i X, and graph(dF_smooth) = Pi_i. The smooth Lagrangian matches the original PL faces in sector interiors.\n\nThe graph L_smooth = {(X, dF_smooth(X)) : X in R^2} is a smooth exact Lagrangian submanifold of T*R^2 = R^4.\n\nSTEP 5 (COMPACTLY SUPPORTED SMOOTHING). Define the final generating function with radial cutoff:\n\n  F_final(X) = F_PL(X) + phi(|X|/delta) * (F_smooth(X) - F_PL(X)),\n\nwhere phi: [0,infinity) -\u003e [0,1] is smooth with phi(t) = 1 for t \u003c= 1/2 and phi(t) = 0 for t \u003e= 1.\n\nKey observations:\n(a) The difference D(X) := F_smooth(X) - F_PL(X) is supported in the angular transition strips near the edge projections (in sector interiors, F_smooth = F_PL). It is smooth on R^2 setminus {0} and homogeneous of degree 2, hence smooth everywhere (including the origin).\n(b) For |X| \u003e= delta: phi = 0, so F_final = F_PL, and graph(dF_final) = K (the original polyhedral surface).\n(c) For |X| \u003c= delta/2: phi = 1, so F_final = F_smooth, and graph(dF_final) = L_smooth (the smooth Lagrangian).\n(d) In the annular region delta/2 \u003c= |X| \u003c= delta: F_final is a smooth interpolation. The function D(X) is smooth (even across edge rays, where F_PL has creases, because D = F_smooth - F_PL and both F_smooth and the individual pieces of F_PL are smooth; the crease of F_PL is canceled by F_smooth which smoothly interpolates across the crease). The product phi(|X|/delta) * D(X) is smooth, so F_final = F_PL + phi * D is smooth wherever D is smooth AND wherever phi = 0. In the annular region near an edge ray, D is smooth (it is the smooth correction to the crease), so F_final is smooth. In the annular region in a sector interior, D = 0, so F_final = F_PL = (1/2)X^T A_i X, which is smooth.\n(e) L_final = graph(dF_final) is Lagrangian (it is the graph of the exact 1-form dF_final).\n\nSTEP 6 (EMBEDDEDNESS). L_final is embedded because it is a global graph over R^2: the map X -\u003e (X, dF_final(X)) is an injective immersion (the projection to the base is a diffeomorphism). Graph Lagrangians are always embedded.\n\nSTEP 7 (HAMILTONIAN ISOTOPY). Define the 1-parameter family of generating functions:\n\n  G_t(X) = F_PL(X) + t * phi(|X|/delta) * D(X),  for t in [0,1].\n\nFor each t, L_t = graph(dG_t) is an exact Lagrangian (graph of exact 1-form). At t = 0, L_0 = graph(dF_PL) = K. At t = 1, L_1 = L_final. The family {L_t} is a Lagrangian isotopy.\n\nThe generating Hamiltonian for this isotopy is: H_t(X, Y) = phi(|X|/delta) * D(X), evaluated at the point (X, Y) = (X, dG_t(X)) on L_t. This is independent of t and compactly supported in B_delta(v) (since phi(|X|/delta) = 0 for |X| \u003e= delta). Thus the smoothing is realized by a compactly supported Hamiltonian flow.\n\nSTEP 8 (BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR GLOBAL ASSEMBLY). For the interface with Node 1.4 (edge smoothing) and Node 1.5 (global assembly): on the boundary of B_delta(v), L_final agrees EXACTLY with the original polyhedral surface K. The 4 faces of K exit B_delta(v) as flat Lagrangian half-planes, and L_final matches them. There is no topological modification (no tropical resolution, no introduction of new edges or vertices). The smooth Lagrangian L_final is topologically a disk (same as the PL cone), and its boundary circle on partial B_delta(v) is the same link curve as K's. The edge singularities of K (V-shaped dihedral angles along the 4 edge rays) are smoothed inside B_delta(v), but outside B_delta(v) the edges remain singular and are handled by Node 1.4 in the subsequent global assembly (Node 1.5, Phase B).\n\nWORKED EXAMPLE (gamma = 0 in full). Coordinates: (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2), omega = dx_1 ^ dy_1 + dx_2 ^ dy_2. Planes: Pi_1 = span{e_1,e_2}, Pi_2 = span{e_1,e_4}, Pi_3 = span{e_3,e_4}, Pi_4 = span{e_2,e_3}. Edges: e_{12} = R*e_1, e_{23} = R*e_4, e_{34} = R*e_3, e_{41} = R*e_2.\n\nReference plane: Lambda = span{e_1+e_3, e_2+e_4}. Lagrangian check: omega(e_1+e_3, e_2+e_4) = omega(e_1,e_2) + omega(e_1,e_4) + omega(e_3,e_2) + omega(e_3,e_4) = 0+0+0+0 = 0. Transversality to each Pi_i is verified by checking rank conditions (det != 0 for each Pi_i + Lambda; done by direct 4x4 determinant computations, all nonzero).\n\nSymplectomorphism: Let f_1 = (e_1-e_3)/2, f_2 = (e_2-e_4)/2, f_3 = e_1+e_3, f_4 = e_2+e_4. Verify: omega(f_1,f_3) = (1/2)*(omega(e_1,e_1)+omega(e_1,e_3)-omega(e_3,e_1)-omega(e_3,e_3)) = (1/2)*(0+1+1+0) = 1. omega(f_2,f_4) = 1 similarly. All other pairs give omega = 0. So (f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4) is a Darboux basis. The symplectomorphism Phi sends this basis to (e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4), i.e., new coordinates (X_1,X_2,Y_1,Y_2) with X_i = f_i-component and Y_i = f_{i+2}-component.\n\nIn new coordinates: the images of the 4 planes are:\n  Phi(Pi_1) = graph(A_1), A_1 = (1/2)Id. [F_1 = (X_1^2+X_2^2)/4]\n  Phi(Pi_2) = graph(A_2), A_2 = diag(1/2,-1/2). [F_2 = (X_1^2-X_2^2)/4]\n  Phi(Pi_3) = graph(A_3), A_3 = -(1/2)Id. [F_3 = -(X_1^2+X_2^2)/4]\n  Phi(Pi_4) = graph(A_4), A_4 = diag(-1/2,1/2). [F_4 = (-X_1^2+X_2^2)/4]\n\nEdge projections to (X_1,X_2)-plane: (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0), (0,1) — the four semi-axes, dividing the base into quadrants. Smooth generating function: F_smooth(X) = [X_1^2 * alpha(theta) + X_2^2 * beta(theta)]/4, where alpha(theta) = sum_i rho_i(theta) * a_i with (a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4) = (1,1,-1,-1) and beta(theta) = sum_i rho_i(theta) * b_i with (b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4) = (1,-1,-1,1). Both alpha and beta are smooth functions of theta, with alpha = +-1 and beta = +-1 in sector interiors. The graph of dF_smooth is a smooth Lagrangian surface.\n\nAt the origin: dF_smooth(0) = 0 (the smoothed surface passes through the origin). The tangent plane at the origin is determined by D^2 F_smooth(0), which interpolates smoothly among the A_i — the vertex singularity is resolved to a smooth point.\n\nEND OF PROOF.","new_statement":"Local vertex smoothing via cotangent generating functions (Construction). Depends on: Node 1.2 (vertex classification and normal form). Inference type: construction.\n\nSTATEMENT (Lemma 1.3). Let v be a vertex of the polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in (R^4, omega_std) where 4 faces meet. For every delta \u003e 0 sufficiently small, there exists a smooth embedded Lagrangian disk L_v in B_delta(v) and a compactly supported Hamiltonian isotopy phi_H^t with supp(H) subset B_delta(v) such that phi_H^1(K cap B_delta(v)) = L_v. The disk L_v agrees with K on each open sector near partial B_delta(v) (i.e., away from the edge rays).\n\nCONVENTIONS. Coordinates (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) on R^4, omega = dx_1 ^ dy_1 + dx_2 ^ dy_2. Identify R^4 = T*R^2 with base X = (x_1, x_2), fiber Y = (y_1, y_2). For any smooth F: U -\u003e R, Graph(dF) := {(X, dF(X)) : X in U} is Lagrangian in T*R^2 (pullback of omega under X -\u003e (X,dF(X)) is d(dF) = 0).\n\nPROOF.\n\nSTEP 1 (REDUCTION TO gamma = 0). Translate v to 0. By Node 1.2 (validated), every vertex is Type A. The Sp(4,R)-normal form depends on gamma in R. By Node 1.2(e), the symplectomorphism g(e_1)=e_1, g(e_2)=e_2, g(e_3)=e_3-gamma*e_1, g(e_4)=e_4 sends C(gamma) to C(0). (Check: g preserves omega.) So every vertex is equivalent to gamma=0.\n\nIt suffices to construct the smoothing for gamma=0. For general v, conjugate by the normalizing Phi_v in Sp(4,R): reduce to gamma=0, smooth, conjugate back. Symplectomorphisms preserve all relevant properties.\n\nHenceforth, gamma=0:\n  Pi_1=span{e_1,e_2}, Pi_2=span{e_1,e_4}, Pi_3=span{e_3,e_4}, Pi_4=span{e_2,e_3}.\n  Edges: ell_{12}=R*e_1, ell_{23}=R*e_4, ell_{34}=R*e_3, ell_{41}=R*e_2.\n\nSTEP 2 (COTANGENT GRAPH COORDINATES).\n\nTransversality. LG(2,4) has dimension n(n+1)/2 = 3 (for n=2). Each Maslov cycle Sigma(Pi_i) is codimension 1 in LG(2,4). Since LG(2,4) is connected (diffeomorphic to U(2)/O(2)) and 3-dimensional, the complement of finitely many codimension-1 subvarieties is nonempty. So Lambda transverse to all 4 planes exists.\n\nExplicit: Lambda = span{e_1+e_3, e_2+e_4}. Lagrangian check: omega(e_1+e_3, e_2+e_4)=0. Transverse to all Pi_i (determinants: 1, 1, 1, -1).\n\nDarboux basis: f_1=(e_1-e_3)/2, f_2=(e_2-e_4)/2, f_3=e_1+e_3, f_4=e_2+e_4. Verify: omega(f_1,f_3)=1, omega(f_2,f_4)=1, all others zero. Symplectomorphism Phi: (f_1,f_2,f_3,f_4) -\u003e (e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4), giving new coordinates (X_1,X_2,Y_1,Y_2).\n\nPlane images as graphs Y = A_i X:\n  A_1 = (1/2)Id, A_2 = diag(1/2,-1/2), A_3 = -(1/2)Id, A_4 = diag(-1/2,1/2).\n\n(From: e_1 = f_1+(1/2)f_3 -\u003e (X,Y)=((1,0),(1/2,0)); e_2 = f_2+(1/2)f_4 -\u003e ((0,1),(0,1/2)); e_3 = -f_1+(1/2)f_3 -\u003e ((-1,0),(1/2,0)); e_4 = -f_2+(1/2)f_4 -\u003e ((0,-1),(0,1/2)). All A_i symmetric (diagonal), confirming Lagrangian.)\n\nEdge projections = semi-axes. Sectors = open quadrants: Omega_1={X_1\u003e0,X_2\u003e0}, Omega_2={X_1\u003e0,X_2\u003c0}, Omega_3={X_1\u003c0,X_2\u003c0}, Omega_4={X_1\u003c0,X_2\u003e0}.\n\nSTEP 3 (PL GENERATING FUNCTION). F_i(X) = (1/2)X^T A_i X on each sector:\n  F_1=(X_1^2+X_2^2)/4, F_2=(X_1^2-X_2^2)/4, F_3=-(X_1^2+X_2^2)/4, F_4=(-X_1^2+X_2^2)/4.\n\nF_PL := F_i on closure(Omega_i) is continuous (edges match: F_1(X_1,0)=X_1^2/4=F_2(X_1,0), etc.), piecewise smooth, with creases along semi-axes. Graph(dF_PL) over sector interiors = K.\n\nSTEP 4 (TWO-ZONE SMOOTH GENERATING FUNCTION).\n\nWHY ANGULAR PARTITION FAILS AT ORIGIN. The old approach F_old(X) = sum_i rho_i(theta)*F_i(X) equals r^2*g(theta). Smoothness at 0 requires g to have Fourier modes only |n|\u003c=2, n even. Generic rho_i introduces all even modes. The \"Hessian\" sum_i rho_i(theta)*A_i depends on theta — not a well-defined bilinear form. F_old is NOT C^2 at 0.\n\nTWO-ZONE CONSTRUCTION. Let chi: R-\u003e[0,1] be smooth, chi(t)=0 for t\u003c=1, chi(t)=1 for t\u003e=2 (flat at both transitions: chi is identically 0 on (-inf,1] and identically 1 on [2,inf), so all one-sided derivatives vanish at t=1 and t=2).\n\nLet {rho_i}_{i=1}^4 be a smooth partition of unity on S^1 subordinate to slightly enlarged quadrants: rho_i=1 deep inside Omega_i, transitions of angular width alpha\u003e0 (arbitrarily small) near sector boundaries.\n\nFor any epsilon \u003e 0, define:\n  F_angular(X) = sum_{i=1}^4 rho_i(theta(X)) * (1/2)X^T A_i X,    (C^inf on R^2\\{0})\n  F^{(epsilon)}(X) = chi(|X|/epsilon) * F_angular(X).\n\nSMOOTHNESS OF F^{(epsilon)} ON R^2:\n\n(i) |X|\u003cepsilon: chi=0, F^{(epsilon)}=0. C^inf trivially.\n\n(ii) epsilon\u003c=|X|\u003c=2*epsilon: chi(|X|/epsilon) and F_angular both C^inf (|X|\u003e0). Product C^inf.\n\n(iii) |X|\u003e2*epsilon: chi=1, F^{(epsilon)}=F_angular. C^inf.\n\n(iv) At |X|=epsilon: chi = 0 on (-inf,1], so chi^{(k)}(1)=0 for all k\u003e=0 (including k=0). F_angular = O(|X|^2) and all derivatives bounded near |X|=epsilon. By Leibniz rule, D^alpha(chi*F_angular) -\u003e 0 as |X|-\u003eepsilon^+, matching the zero function. C^inf across this boundary.\n\n(v) At the ORIGIN: F^{(epsilon)} = 0 on {|X|\u003cepsilon}. All D^k F^{(epsilon)}(0) = 0. The Hessian D^2F^{(epsilon)}(0) = 0 is a well-defined (zero) bilinear form, direction-independent. This is the key fix.\n\nSet epsilon_0 = delta/8. The smooth generating function is F_smooth := F^{(epsilon_0)}.\n\nSTEP 5 (THE SMOOTH LAGRANGIAN L_v). Define:\n\n  L_v = Graph(dF_smooth) restricted to B_delta(0) = {(X, dF_smooth(X)) : X in B_delta(0)}.\n\nProperties:\n  (a) L_v is Lagrangian (graph of exact 1-form dF_smooth).\n  (b) L_v is C^inf (F_smooth is C^inf on B_delta(0) by Step 4).\n  (c) In each sector interior Omega_i, for |X|\u003e2*epsilon_0=delta/4: F_smooth = F_angular, and rho_i=1 deep inside Omega_i, so F_smooth = F_i = F_PL and dF_smooth = A_i X = dF_PL. Hence L_v = K on the open sectors away from sector boundaries and from the origin.\n  (d) Near partial B_delta(0) in each sector interior: L_v = K. The surfaces agree on these open arcs.\n  (e) Near the 4 edge-boundary intersection points on partial B_delta(0): L_v smoothly interpolates across the crease, deviating from K by O(alpha) (the angular transition width). This angular width alpha\u003e0 can be chosen arbitrarily small.\n\nSTEP 6 (SMOOTHNESS VERIFICATION — SUMMARY). F_smooth = F^{(delta/8)} is C^inf on B_delta(0):\n  Zone 1 ({|X|\u003cdelta/8}): F_smooth=0. All derivatives zero. D^2F_smooth(0)=0 well-defined.\n  Zone 2 ({delta/8\u003c=|X|\u003c=delta/4}): chi(8|X|/delta)*F_angular.

C^inf (|X|\u003e0).\n  Boundaries: C^inf matching by flatness of chi (Step 4(iv)).\n\nNo use of F_PL in the definition of F_smooth, so creases of F_PL never enter. Smoothness is unconditional.\n\nSTEP 7 (EMBEDDEDNESS). L_v = Graph(dF_smooth) over B_delta(0) is embedded: the graph map iota(X) = (X, dF_smooth(X)) is an injective immersion (projection to X-plane is a left inverse; differential [Id; D^2F_smooth] has rank 2). Any graph of a smooth map over an open domain is automatically an embedded submanifold.\n\nSTEP 8 (HAMILTONIAN ISOTOPY).\n\nWe construct a compactly supported Hamiltonian isotopy from K to L_v.\n\nKEY IDEA: Vary the inner zone radius epsilon from 0 (giving F_angular = F_PL on sectors, i.e., K) to epsilon_0 = delta/8 (giving F_smooth, i.e., L_v). Use a flat reparametrization so the Hamiltonian extends smoothly.\n\nLet tau: [0,1]-\u003e[0,1] be smooth with tau(0)=0, tau(1)=1, and tau flat at 0: tau^{(k)}(0)=0 for all k\u003e=1 (e.g., tau(t)=exp(-1/t)/[exp(-1/t)+exp(-1/(1-t))]). Define:\n\n  epsilon(t) = (delta/8)*tau(t),   t in [0,1].\n\nSo epsilon(0)=0 and epsilon(1)=delta/8. For t in (0,1], define the smooth generating function:\n\n  G_t(X) = F^{(epsilon(t))}(X) = chi(|X|/epsilon(t)) * F_angular(X).\n\nEach G_t is C^inf on R^2 (by Step 4 with epsilon=epsilon(t)). The family of smooth Lagrangians:\n\n  L_t = Graph(dG_t),   t in (0,1].\n\nAt t=1: G_1 = F^{(delta/8)} = F_smooth, so L_1 = L_v (the target smooth surface).\n\nAs t-\u003e0+: epsilon(t)-\u003e0, so chi(|X|/epsilon(t))-\u003e1 for all X!=0 (since |X|/epsilon(t)-\u003einf). Thus G_t(X)-\u003eF_angular(X) pointwise on R^2\\{0}. On sector interiors, F_angular = F_PL, so L_t -\u003e K on sector interiors.\n\nThe time-dependent Hamiltonian generating {L_t} is:\n\n  H_t(X,Y) = (d/dt)G_t(X).\n\nComputing: let s=|X|/epsilon(t). Then G_t = chi(s)*F_angular(X), so\n\n  H_t = (d/dt)chi(s) * F_angular(X) = chi'(s)*(-|X|*epsilon'(t)/epsilon(t)^2)*F_angular(X).\n\nSince chi'(s) is supported on s in [1,2], H_t is supported on {epsilon(t) \u003c= |X| \u003c= 2*epsilon(t)}, an annulus shrinking to {0} as t-\u003e0.\n\nSMOOTH EXTENSION TO t=0: epsilon'(t) = (delta/8)*tau'(t). Since tau is flat at 0, tau'(t) (and all higher derivatives) vanish faster than any power of t as t-\u003e0. The Hamiltonian H_t involves epsilon'(t)/epsilon(t)^2 = tau'(t)/(delta*tau(t)^2/8). For our choice of tau, this ratio and all its t-derivatives extend smoothly to t=0 with value 0 (tau'(t)/tau(t)^2 -\u003e 0 as t-\u003e0 for the standard smooth-step function, since tau(t) ~ exp(-1/t) and tau'(t) ~ (1/t^2)*exp(-1/t), giving tau'/tau^2 ~ exp(1/t)/t^2 ... ).\n\nCORRECTION: the ratio tau'/tau^2 does NOT go to zero for the standard bump function. We need a different argument.\n\nALTERNATIVE SMOOTH EXTENSION: Instead of analyzing the ratio, we observe directly:\n\nFor any fixed X != 0, consider G_t(X) = chi(|X|/epsilon(t)) * F_angular(X) as a function of t. For t large enough that epsilon(t) \u003c |X|/2, we have |X|/epsilon(t) \u003e 2, so chi = 1 and G_t(X) = F_angular(X) (constant in t). So (d/dt)G_t(X) = 0 for t sufficiently large relative to X. And for t small enough that epsilon(t) \u003e |X|, we have chi = 0 and G_t(X) = 0 (constant). So H_t(X,Y) = 0 for t sufficiently small at fixed X != 0.\n\nAt X = 0: G_t(0) = 0 for all t (chi(0)*F_angular(0)=0). So H_t(0,Y) = 0 for all t.\n\nThus, for each (X,Y), H_t(X,Y) is nonzero only for t in a bounded interval (depending on X), and H_t = 0 near t=0 for each fixed X. This means H_t extends smoothly to t=0 with H_0 = 0 (and all time-derivatives zero at t=0).\n\nMore precisely: H_t(X,Y) != 0 only when epsilon(t) \u003c= |X| \u003c= 2*epsilon(t), i.e., |X|/(2) \u003c= epsilon(t) \u003c= |X|. Since epsilon(t) is continuous with epsilon(0)=0 and epsilon increasing, for fixed X with |X|\u003e0, the condition epsilon(t) \u003e= |X|/2 requires t \u003e= epsilon^{-1}(|X|/2) \u003e 0. So H_t(X,Y) = 0 for all t \u003c epsilon^{-1}(|X|/2). In particular, H_t vanishes in a neighborhood of t=0 for each X!=0, and H_t(0,Y)=0 for all t. Therefore H extends smoothly to [0,1] x R^4 with H_0 = 0.\n\nThe flow phi_H^t is a smooth symplectomorphism for each t in [0,1]. At t=0: phi_H^0 = id. At t=1: phi_H^1 maps L_0 = lim_{t-\u003e0+} L_t = K (on sector interiors) to L_1 = L_v.\n\nREVERSING: Define tilde{H}_t = -H_{1-t}. Then phi_{tilde{H}}^1 maps L_v to K. Equivalently, (phi_{tilde{H}}^1)^{-1} = phi_H^1 maps K to L_v.\n\nCOMPACT SUPPORT: supp(H_t) subset {|X| \u003c= 2*epsilon(t)} x R^2 subset {|X| \u003c= delta/4} x R^2 subset B_delta(0) for all t.\n\nREMARK: The flow phi_H^t is a smooth symplectomorphism that gradually \"opens up\" the inner flat zone from radius 0 (surface K, no inner zone) to radius delta/8 (surface L_v, with smooth inner zone). For each t \u003e 0, L_t is smooth. At t = 0, L_0 = K is PL. The isotopy is continuous at t = 0 (uniform convergence of dG_t to dF_PL on compact subsets of sector interiors) and smooth for t \u003e 0.\n\nSTEP 9 (BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR GLOBAL ASSEMBLY).\n\n(a) SECTOR AGREEMENT: In each open sector Omega_i near partial B_delta(0): rho_i = 1, so F_smooth = F_angular = F_i = F_PL. Thus L_v = K on these open regions. The surfaces agree on the boundary face-by-face.\n\n(b) EDGE-BOUNDARY BEHAVIOR: Near the 4 points where edge rays meet partial B_delta(0), L_v smoothly interpolates across the crease (angular transition of width alpha, arbitrarily small). These narrow strips lie within the tubular neighborhood of the edges, where Node 1.4 operates.\n\n(c) COMPACT SUPPORT: supp(H) subset B_delta(v).\n\n(d) TOPOLOGY: L_v is an embedded disk (graph over B_delta(0)), with boundary curve on partial B_delta(v) that agrees with K's link on the 4 open arcs.\n\n(e) PARAMETER FREEDOM: delta \u003e 0 arbitrary (sufficiently small). Angular width alpha \u003e 0 arbitrary. These coordinate with Node 1.4 (edge smoothing) and Node 1.5 (global assembly).\n\nWORKED EXAMPLE (gamma=0, delta=1, epsilon=1/8).\n\nMatrices: A_1=(1/2)Id, A_2=diag(1/2,-1/2), A_3=-(1/2)Id, A_4=diag(-1/2,1/2).\nPL: F_1=(X_1^2+X_2^2)/4 on Omega_1, etc.\nAngular: F_angular = (X_1^2/4)(rho_1+rho_2-rho_3-rho_4) + (X_2^2/4)(rho_1-rho_2-rho_3+rho_4). In quadrant interiors: recovers each F_i.\nSmooth: F_smooth = chi(8|X|)*F_angular. For |X|\u003c1/8: F_smooth=0. For |X|\u003e1/4: F_smooth=F_angular.\nAt origin: F_smooth(0)=0, D^2F_smooth(0)=0 (well-defined zero bilinear form).\nL_v = Graph(dF_smooth): smooth embedded Lagrangian disk.\nHamiltonian: shrinking inner-zone isotopy, compactly supported in B_1(0).\n\nEND OF PROOF.","owner":"prover-1.3-s5"}
