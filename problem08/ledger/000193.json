Step 1a asserts 'D is smooth by the homogeneity argument in Node 1.3, Step 5(d)' and concludes H_v = phi(|X|/delta)*D(X) is smooth. However, Node 1.3 has three open CRITICAL challenges (ch-718a9a57ae5, ch-7313ffe7860, ch-34ff33544ce) establishing that: (1) F_smooth is NOT C^infinity at the origin because the angular partition of unity rho_i(theta(X)) introduces theta = atan2(X_2,X_1) which is not smooth at 0; (2) D(X) = F_smooth - F_PL also fails to be smooth at the origin for the same reason; (3) the Hessian D^2F_smooth(0) is direction-dependent (varies with theta), contradicting the claim that a homogeneous-degree-2 function with smooth angular part is smooth. If D is not smooth, then H_v is not smooth, the Hamiltonian vector field X_{H_v} is not well-defined as a smooth vector field, and the flow phi_t^{H_v} is not a smooth diffeomorphism. This invalidates the entire Hamiltonian construction at vertices. The node must either: (a) wait for Node 1.3 to resolve these challenges, providing a genuinely smooth D, or (b) provide an independent argument that H_v generates a well-defined isotopy even when D is only piecewise smooth (which would require a fundamentally different approach, e.g., continuous Hamiltonian flows in the sense of Oh-Mueller).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
