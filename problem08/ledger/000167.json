Node 1.3 has 3 open CRITICAL challenges (ch-718a9a57ae5, ch-7313ffe7860, ch-34ff33544ce) establishing that: (1) F_smooth is NOT C-infinity at the origin (angular partition of unity introduces high Fourier modes; r^2*g(theta) requires g to have only n=0,+-2 modes, but the partition of unity generically introduces all even modes). (2) The Hessian D^2 F_smooth(0) depends on direction of approach (A_1=(1/2)Id along theta=0 vs A_3=-(1/2)Id along theta=pi), proving the function is not even C^2. (3) D(X) = F_smooth - F_PL inherits this non-smoothness. CONSEQUENCES FOR NODE 1.5: Since the Hamiltonian H_{v_i} from Node 1.3 involves phi(|X|/delta)*D(X) which is NOT smooth at the vertex, the combined Hamiltonian H_A = sum H_{v_i} is NOT a smooth function on R^4. Therefore: (a) Step 3's claim that H_A is 'well-defined and smooth on R^4' is FALSE. (b) The flow phi_t^{H_A} is not a well-defined smooth diffeomorphism of R^4. (c) Step 7(A) claim 'smooth by Node 1.3 Step 4' inherits the failure. (d) Step 8 embeddedness argument fails. (e) Step 9 Lagrangian preservation argument fails. This is a STRUCTURAL COLLAPSE: every step invoking smooth Hamiltonian flow is invalidated.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
