For general gamma, Step 2 says 'a smooth family Lambda(gamma) can be chosen' by openness, and Step 3 says the construction carries through. However: (a) The A_i matrices for general gamma are never computed, so the Fourier mode structure of g(theta) is unknown for gamma \\!= 0. (b) Even the gamma=0 case fails (per the smoothness challenge), but for general gamma there could be additional issues — e.g., the sectors might not align with coordinate axes, the edge projections might not be orthogonal, etc. (c) Node 1.2 claims gamma can be eliminated (all Type A equivalent to gamma=0), making this concern moot IF Node 1.2 is correct. But Node 1.3 explicitly presents the general gamma case in Step 1, creating an obligation to handle it or to explicitly invoke Node 1.2's equivalence claim.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
