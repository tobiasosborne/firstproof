Step 4 describes extending Phase A's radius from delta to delta+eta, so Phase A smooths the surface out to |X| = delta+eta. Phase B's Hamiltonian chi_long(r) transitions from 0 at r = delta+eta to 1 at r = delta+eta+epsilon. This means Phase A is supported in |X| \u003c= delta+eta and Phase B is supported in |X| \u003e= delta+eta (along the edge). Their supports share at most the boundary |X| = delta+eta. However, Step 6 then contradicts this by claiming: 'Phase A and Phase B do NOT have disjoint supports in general (they overlap in the annular transition zones near vertex ball boundaries).' If the supports are as described in Step 4, they DO NOT overlap, and the sequential approach is NOT needed for the reason stated. The sequential approach IS still needed, but for a DIFFERENT reason: Phase B must know the surface state at its input (smooth from Phase A or PL from K), not because of Hamiltonian interference. The explanation in Step 6 is wrong. Furthermore, the delta+eta extension in Step 4 requires redefining Step 1's parameter choices: the original vertex balls were chosen with delta \u003c (1/2)*min d(v_i,v_j). The extended balls B_{delta+eta}(v_i) must also be pairwise disjoint, requiring eta \u003c (1/2)*(min d(v_i,v_j) - 2*delta). This constraint is never stated. If eta is too large, the extended balls could overlap, invalidating Phase A's disjoint-support argument.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
