For Type B vertices (two transverse Lagrangian planes), apply Polterovich-Lalonde-Sikorav surgery: the neck H_lambda = {(z_1,z_2) in C^2 : Im(z_1 bar{z_2})=0, |z_1|^2-|z_2|^2=lambda} is a smooth Lagrangian converging to L_1 union L_2 as lambda-\u003e0. For Type A vertices (4 distinct planes), apply tropical resolution: split the 4-valent configuration into two 3-valent configurations connected by an edge, then smooth each using the Matessi-Mikhalkin Lagrangian pair-of-pants construction. In both cases the surgery is generated by a compactly supported Hamiltonian.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"e7139e480c156fd03147ee4ef8a36cd4aa69aa4a7450016c383caa44f0257568","created":"2026-02-10T21:15:47.966145424Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
