The node claims the smoothing is 'supported in a tubular neighborhood of e' but says nothing about what happens at the endpoints of e where edges meet vertices. After Phase A (vertex smoothing from node 1.3), the surface near each vertex is already smooth. The edge smoothing in Phase B must produce a smooth surface that matches the vertex smoothing at the boundary. Specifically: (1) At each endpoint of e, the vertex smoothing from node 1.3 has already replaced the PL surface with a smooth Lagrangian in a ball B_delta(v). The edge smoothing must agree with this smooth Lagrangian on the overlap. (2) The 'adapted coordinates' normalization from (a) is specific to the edge -- it is NOT the same as any normalization used for the vertex smoothing. There is no guarantee that the edge smoothing (constructed in edge-adapted coordinates) is compatible with the vertex smoothing (constructed in vertex-adapted coordinates) in the transition region. (3) This compatibility issue is the HARDEST part of the edge smoothing step and is entirely absent from the node's statement. The node should either: (a) defer this to node 1.5 (global assembly) with an explicit dependency, or (b) include a statement about boundary conditions the edge smoothing must satisfy and show they can be met.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
