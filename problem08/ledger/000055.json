It explicitly requires: (1) Node 1.2 (vertex classification) — to know that vertices are Type A only, and to understand the local geometry. (2) Node 1.3 (vertex smoothing) — Phase A directly applies the output of 1.3 at every vertex. The statement 'smooth all vertices simultaneously using disjoint balls B_delta(v)' assumes 1.3 provides a vertex smoothing supported in B_delta(v). (3) Node 1.4 (edge smoothing) — Phase B applies the output of 1.4 along every edge. The claim 'smooth all remaining edge singularities' assumes 1.4 provides an edge smoothing with appropriate properties. Without these dependencies, the node is an unsupported assertion. The inference type 'assumption' is also inappropriate: this is a CONSTRUCTION step that should be a 'claim' derived from 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 as premises. The node should be reformulated as: 'Given vertex smoothings (1.3) and edge smoothings (1.4) with specified properties, the global assembly produces a smooth Lagrangian.' Currently it reads as an independent assumption, which makes the proof tree logically disconnected.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
