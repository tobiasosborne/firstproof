Step 3 says: 'the simultaneous flow equals the composition in any order: phi_t^{H_A} = phi_t^{H_v_1} o ... o phi_t^{H_v_N}.' This is stated for general t, but the equality phi_t^{H_1+H_2} = phi_t^{H_1} o phi_t^{H_2} holds for ALL t simultaneously only when [X_{H_1}, X_{H_2}] = 0 (which follows from disjoint supports). The equation should more precisely state: the flow of the sum H_A = sum H_{v_i} equals the PRODUCT of the individual flows: phi_t^{H_A} = phi_t^{H_v_1} o ... o phi_t^{H_v_N} for all t. This follows from the BCH formula since all commutators vanish. The statement is correct but the implication (disjoint supports -\u003e vanishing Poisson bracket -\u003e commuting flows -\u003e flow of sum = composition of flows) should be made explicit.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
