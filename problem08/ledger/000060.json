The claimed neck H_lambda = {Im(z_1 bar{z_2})=0, |z_1|^2 - |z_2|^2 = lambda} is NOT a Lagrangian submanifold. Writing f_1 = Im(z_1 bar{z_2}) = y_1 x_2 - x_1 y_2 and f_2 = |z_1|^2 - |z_2|^2, the Poisson bracket is {f_1, f_2} = -4 Re(z_1 bar{z_2}). On H_lambda, Im(z_1 bar{z_2})=0, so z_1 bar{z_2} is REAL, meaning Re(z_1 bar{z_2}) = z_1 bar{z_2} which is generically nonzero. A complete intersection {f_1=0, f_2=lambda} is Lagrangian iff {f_1,f_2}=0 on the level set. Since Re(z_1 bar{z_2}) is not identically zero on H_lambda, the tangent space of H_lambda is NOT a Lagrangian subspace. The correct Polterovich surgery neck involves a more sophisticated construction (profile curve in phase-radius coordinates, not a simple algebraic complete intersection). Although the Type B case is vacuous (per challenge ch-e3f2fa45614e3849 on node 1.2), this formula error undermines confidence in the node's mathematical precision.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
