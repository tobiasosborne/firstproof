The node states 'each vertex singularity admits a local Lagrangian smoothing' as if this were a theorem being invoked. But this is the THEOREM TO BE PROVED — it is the hard content of this node. The node then gives a strategy (tropical resolution + Matessi-Mikhalkin), but: (1) The strategy is described at a high level without any of the required verification steps. (2) No explicit construction is given for even a SINGLE example vertex. The standard example Pi_1=span{e1,e2}, Pi_2=span{e1,e4}, Pi_3=span{e3,e4}, Pi_4=span{e2,e3} (using the convention from the HANDOFF where e3=y1, e4=y2) is a Type A vertex. What does the smoothing look like explicitly for THIS vertex? (3) Without at least one worked example, the feasibility of the tropical resolution approach cannot be assessed. The node should demonstrate the construction on the standard example before claiming it works in general.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
