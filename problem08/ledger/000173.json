Step 7(E) claims: 'Points in the Phase B transition zone (boundary of Phase B support near vertex balls): Here H_B is tapering to zero, and K_A is smooth (from Phase A). Phase B flow applied to a smooth submanifold K_A at a point where H_B is smooth yields a smooth submanifold.' The problem: K_A is NOT smooth at the points in the Phase B transition zone along edges. K_A is smooth inside vertex balls (Phase A) and equals K (PL with creases) outside vertex balls. The Phase B transition zone is the strip [delta+eta, delta+eta+epsilon] FROM vertices along edges. In this strip, Phase A has phi=0 (no smoothing), so K_A = K (PL with V-shaped crease). Phase B applies chi_long * H_{edge} where chi_long is ramping from 0 to 1. The flow of this Hamiltonian acts on K_A, which has a crease here. The resulting surface L = phi_1^{H_B}(K_A) at these points is NOT obviously smooth, because the flow of a smooth Hamiltonian applied to a non-smooth surface does not generally produce a smooth surface at the non-smooth points. The claim 'K_A is smooth (from Phase A)' at these points is FALSE — Phase A does not act here. The argument is circular: it assumes Phase A smoothed the region that Phase A was designed to leave untouched.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
