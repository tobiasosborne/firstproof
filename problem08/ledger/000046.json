Under the more common convention (x1,y1,x2,y2), Pi_1=span{e1,e2}=span{x1,y1} is NOT Lagrangian (omega(e1,e2) = dx1^dy1(x1,y1) = 1). The node does not specify which convention is used. This ambiguity must be resolved, as different readers may verify the example under different conventions and reach contradictory conclusions.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
