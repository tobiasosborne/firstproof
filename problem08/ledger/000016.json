(a) Maslov class: piecewise constant on faces, with even local Maslov index at each 4-valent vertex; compatible with smooth Lagrangian Maslov classes. (b) Floer theory: R^4 is exact symplectic, so no non-constant holomorphic disks with boundary on exact Lagrangians; m_0=0 and Floer theory is unobstructed. (c) Non-orientability: ruled out as input by Shevchishin-Nemirovski (no embedded Lagrangian Klein bottle in R^4) combined with chi(L)=0 for compact Lagrangians. (d) Monodromy: the parameter space of local smoothings at each vertex is contractible (product of half-lines), so no monodromy obstruction prevents global consistency.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"3349a740f871df2358a30d418c974c6f9c0c80dc923bd0ddc1c202dbcf5530bd","created":"2026-02-10T21:15:47.966163446Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
