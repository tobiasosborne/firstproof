Given the HANDOFF warning that no PL Darboux theorem exists (Jauberteau-Rollin 2024), this phrase is ambiguous and potentially misleading. The correct interpretation is: a global LINEAR symplectomorphism of R^4 can normalize the edge to the x_1-axis and one face to the x_1-x_2 plane. This is a standard Sp(4,R) linear algebra fact, NOT a neighborhood theorem. The node should explicitly state this is a linear change of coordinates, not a local chart adapted to the PL Lagrangian. Without this clarification, the argument could be read as invoking a Weinstein-type neighborhood theorem that does not exist for PL Lagrangians.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
