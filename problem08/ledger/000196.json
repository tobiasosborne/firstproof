Part (e3) claims '||H_v||_{C^0} = O(delta^2) (the generating function difference D(X) is homogeneous of degree 2, cut off at radius delta)'. This estimate requires D(X) = F_smooth(X) - F_PL(X) to be smooth and homogeneous of degree 2. However, Node 1.3 currently has OPEN CRITICAL challenges (ch-718a9a57ae5: 'SMOOTHNESS AT ORIGIN FAILS: F_smooth is NOT C^2 at the origin' and ch-7313ffe7860: 'D(X) = F_smooth - F_PL ALSO FAILS smoothness at origin') that directly dispute whether D(X) is smooth at the origin. If the generating function is not C^2 at the origin, the energy estimate ||H_v||_{C^0} = O(delta^2) is not automatically justified — the C^0 norm of a non-smooth function may not scale as expected from homogeneity of a smooth function. The homogeneity argument works as follows for smooth functions: if D is smooth and homogeneous of degree 2, then D(X) = |X|^2 * D(X/|X|), giving ||D||_{C^0(B_delta)} = delta^2 * max_{S^1} |D|. But if D has a singularity at the origin (e.g., is only C^{1,alpha} for alpha \u003c 1), the C^0 bound still holds by homogeneity (since |D(X)| \u003c= C|X|^2 for homogeneous degree 2 functions even without smoothness), but the HAMILTONIAN flow generated by a non-smooth H may not produce a smooth Lagrangian, undermining the entire construction. Node 1.8 should explicitly state that the energy bound and its consequences are CONDITIONAL on Node 1.3's smoothness issues being resolved. Currently, the node presents the energy bound as established fact.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
