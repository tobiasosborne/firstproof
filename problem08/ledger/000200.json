Step 2 states that Phase B smooths edges on the surface phi_1^{H_A}(K) using edge Hamiltonians H_e. But the edge Hamiltonians from Step 1b are defined using the edge-adapted coordinates of the ORIGINAL polyhedral surface K. After the Phase A vertex flow phi_1^{H_A}, the surface near edges (outside vertex balls) is unchanged (phi_1^{H_A} = identity outside vertex balls since H_A is supported in the union of vertex balls). So H_e is correctly defined on the PL edges of phi_1^{H_A}(K) = K outside vertex balls. This is correct but should be explicitly stated: the push-forward (phi_1^{H_A})* H_B in the concatenation formula equals H_B outside the vertex balls (where H_A = 0), and inside the vertex balls H_B = 0 (edge supports are outside vertex balls). Therefore (phi_1^{H_A})* H_B = H_B circ (phi_1^{H_A})^{-1} = H_B everywhere, and the concatenation simplifies. The notation with the pullback is correct but potentially misleading since it equals the identity transformation on the support of H_B. A clarifying sentence would improve readability.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
