The exhaustion argument claims 'the sequence H_n stabilizes for n large enough' on compact sets, and that 'the limit H_infinity = lim H_n is a well-defined smooth function.' This stabilization claim requires that the Hamiltonian for smoothing vertex v and edge e does not change as the exhaustion parameter n increases. This is TRUE (because H_v depends only on the local geometry near v and is supported in B_delta(v), so once n is large enough that B_delta(v) is contained in B_n(0), the contribution H_v does not change). However, the argument should also address: (1) The boundary issue: K_n = K cap B_n(0) may have boundary vertices (where fewer than 4 faces meet because some faces are cut off by the sphere of radius n). The parenthetical remark 'treat boundary vertices by extending K_n slightly beyond B_n(0)' requires choosing the extension consistently — if the extension of K_n and K_{n+1} differ near the boundary of B_n(0), the Hamiltonians H_n and H_{n+1} could disagree. A cleaner approach: observe that for any INTERIOR vertex v (whose star is fully contained in B_n), the Hamiltonian H_v is the same in all K_n with n large enough. Never smooth boundary vertices; only smooth interior cells. This gives stabilization without needing boundary extensions. (2) The smoothness of H_infinity: local finiteness plus stabilization gives that H_infinity is smooth (it locally equals some H_n). This should be stated rather than just implied. (3) Completeness of phi_infinity: the flow of H_infinity is complete because H_infinity locally agrees with H_n (which is compactly supported hence complete), and the flow on any compact set agrees with the flow of H_n for n large. These are routine but the details matter for non-compact surfaces.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
