The reasoning is correct but slightly misleading about the mechanism. The flux obstruction lives in H^1(L_t; R), not H^1(R^4; R). The vanishing follows because L_t is diffeomorphic to R^2, so H^1(L_t; R) = 0 directly. The appeal to H^1(R^4) = 0 works indirectly (the closed 1-form iota_{X_t} omega on R^4 is exact, so its restriction to L_t is exact), but this requires (a) extending the velocity field X_t to all of R^4, and (b) knowing that iota_{X_t} omega is closed on R^4 — the latter requires more justification (it is NOT automatic; closedness of omega alone does not make iota_X omega closed for arbitrary X). The direct route via H^1(L_t) = 0 is cleaner and avoids this subtlety. The conclusion is correct regardless.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
