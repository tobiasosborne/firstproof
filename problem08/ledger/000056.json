The statement says 'smooth all vertices simultaneously using disjoint balls B_delta(v)' but does not justify the existence of such delta. For a COMPACT polyhedral surface K with finitely many vertices v_1,...,v_N, one can choose delta \u003c (1/2) * min_{i \\!= j} d(v_i, v_j), and the balls are disjoint. This is straightforward but should be stated explicitly. For a NON-COMPACT polyhedral surface K with infinitely many vertices, there need not exist a UNIFORM delta \u003e 0 such that all balls B_delta(v) are disjoint. The infimum of inter-vertex distances could be zero if vertices accumulate. Counter-scenario: consider an infinite polyhedral Lagrangian surface with vertices at positions v_n where d(v_n, v_{n+1}) -\u003e 0 as n -\u003e infinity. (Whether such surfaces actually exist as topological submanifolds of R^4 with Lagrangian faces is a separate question, but the node does not argue they cannot exist.) In the non-compact case, one needs either: (a) a proof that the polyhedral complex hypothesis forces a positive lower bound on inter-vertex distances, or (b) a LOCALLY FINITE approach where delta = delta(v) varies per vertex, chosen so that B_{delta(v)}(v) is disjoint from B_{delta(w)}(w) for all adjacent vertices w. This is possible by a greedy argument (choose delta(v) \u003c (1/2) d(v, nearest other vertex)) but requires the vertex set to be locally finite (which follows from 'finite polyhedral complex' if K is compact, but needs argument for non-compact K with infinitely many cells). The claim as stated is incomplete for the non-compact case.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
