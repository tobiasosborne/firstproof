The secondary exactness argument in Step 4(b) claims 'K_t = graph(dG_t) in cotangent coordinates' and concludes each K_t is an exact Lagrangian. But this cotangent graph representation is only valid near VERTICES (inside the balls B_delta(v)), where the generating function construction of Node 1.3 applies. Along edge segments (Phase B), the surface is NOT a cotangent graph — it is the product construction {(x_1, gamma(s), 0)} from Node 1.4, which lives in the hyperplane {y_1 = 0} and is parametrized by (x_1, s), not by base coordinates (X_1, X_2) with fiber dF. The node partially addresses this by computing lambda|_{L_epsilon} for the edge case, but the argument that this is 'exact in t' is imprecise: exactness of a Lagrangian means lambda|_L = df for some function f on L, not just that a particular expression is 'exact in t.' For the edge construction, one needs: lambda = y_1 dx_1 + y_2 dx_2 restricted to {(x_1, gamma_1(s), 0, gamma_2(s))} equals 0*dx_1 + gamma_2(s)*d(gamma_1(s)) = gamma_2 * gamma_1' ds. This is exact (as a 1-form on L) if and only if gamma_2 * gamma_1' ds = dG for some function G(x_1, s) — but since it does not depend on x_1, G(s) = integral gamma_2 gamma_1' ds exists. However, for the INTERMEDIATE surface K_t (during the isotopy from V-profile to smooth profile), one must verify exactness at each time t. More importantly, at the JUNCTION between vertex regions and edge regions, the cotangent graph primitive and the edge primitive must agree (differ by a constant) to give a GLOBAL exact primitive on K_t. This patching of local exactness primitives to a global one is not addressed.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
