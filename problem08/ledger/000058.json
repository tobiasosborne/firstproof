This is the most serious issue with node 1.5 and was already flagged as a major challenge on node 1.4 (ch-74b06d9cada). The problem is as follows:\n\nAfter Phase A (vertex smoothing), near each vertex v, the surface K is smooth inside B_delta(v). Outside B_delta(v), the surface is still polyhedral (V-shaped along edges). At the boundary of B_delta(v), where the smooth vertex region meets the still-singular edge, there must be a SMOOTH TRANSITION. But the node says nothing about how this transition works.\n\nThe precise issue: Consider an edge e connecting vertices v and w. After Phase A:\n- Inside B_delta(v): the surface is smooth (from vertex smoothing of v).\n- Inside B_delta(w): the surface is smooth (from vertex smoothing of w).\n- Between the two balls (the 'middle segment' of e): the surface is still V-shaped.\n\nPhase B smooths the middle segment. But Phase B must produce a result that:\n(1) Matches the vertex smoothing output at the boundary of B_delta(v).\n(2) Matches the vertex smoothing output at the boundary of B_delta(w).\n(3) Is smooth Lagrangian everywhere in between.\n\nThe claim 'after Phase A, edges meet vertex regions in smooth Lagrangian arcs' is stated as if it were obvious, but it encodes a NON-TRIVIAL BOUNDARY CONDITION MATCHING PROBLEM. The vertex smoothing (node 1.3) uses either tropical resolution or Polterovich surgery, which produces a smooth surface inside B_delta(v) with a specific profile near the boundary. The edge smoothing (node 1.4) uses a product construction (line x curve) which has a different geometric character. These two constructions were designed INDEPENDENTLY — there is no guarantee they match at the boundary.\n\nConcretely: at the boundary circle of B_delta(v) intersected with a transverse plane to the edge, the vertex smoothing has produced some smooth curve gamma_v. The edge smoothing needs to produce a curve that AGREES with gamma_v at one end and with gamma_w at the other end. The edge smoothing profile must interpolate between these two boundary curves while remaining Lagrangian. This is possible if and only if both boundary curves are smooth and the interpolation can be done within the Lagrangian constraint.\n\nThe node asserts this matching is trivial ('edges meet vertex regions in smooth Lagrangian arcs') but provides no construction, no proof, and no reference. This is a genuine gap that could be fatal to the proof: if the vertex and edge smoothings are incompatible at the boundary, the global surface has non-smooth junctions at the boundaries of vertex balls, which are NOT removable by Phase B as described.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
