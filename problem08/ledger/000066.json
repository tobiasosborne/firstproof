The node claims to 'split the 4-valent configuration into two 3-valent configurations connected by an edge' but provides NO CONSTRUCTION for how this splitting works for a general Type A vertex of a polyhedral Lagrangian surface. The tropical resolution concept comes from tropical geometry, where a 4-valent vertex of a tropical curve in R^2 can be deformed into two 3-valent vertices. However: (1) A general polyhedral Lagrangian surface in R^4 does NOT arise from a tropical curve — the tropical-to-Lagrangian correspondence (Mikhalkin 2019) starts from tropical curves in R^2 and lifts to (C*)^2, not R^4. (2) The 'splitting' of a 4-valent tropical vertex requires the TROPICAL BALANCING CONDITION (sum of primitive edge vectors = 0 at each vertex), which is an additional constraint not known to hold for general polyhedral Lagrangian vertices. (3) Even if we can combinatorially split 4 faces into two groups of 3, the resulting 3-face configuration must satisfy specific geometric conditions (balancing) for the pair-of-pants to apply. The node handwaves over the most difficult step: showing that an arbitrary 4-face Lagrangian cone can be deformed to a configuration where tropical resolution applies. This is the central gap in the proof.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
