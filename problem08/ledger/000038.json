The correct proof of edge smoothing is a 4-line explicit construction that requires no Moser correction whatsoever. Here is the complete correct proof: (1) By linear symplectomorphism, normalize: edge e = x_1-axis, Face F_1 in the half-plane {y_1=0, y_2=0, x_2\u003e=0}, Face F_2 in {y_1=0, x_2=cos(theta)*t, y_2=sin(theta)*t, t\u003e=0}. (2) Choose any smooth curve gamma_epsilon(t) in the (x_2,y_2)-plane interpolating between the two rays, with transition in an epsilon-neighborhood. (3) Define L_epsilon = {(x_1, 0, gamma_epsilon(t)) : x_1 in R, t in R}. (4) L_epsilon is Lagrangian because dy_1=0 on L_epsilon (killing dx_1^dy_1) and (x_2,y_2) depend on the single parameter t (killing dx_2^dy_2). QED. The Lagrangian condition is preserved EXACTLY, with zero symplectic error. The Moser correction, the formula 'omega|_{K_mollified} = d(alpha_epsilon)', and the Hamiltonian generation claim are all red herrings addressing a non-existent problem. The node should be rewritten with this explicit construction as the proof, not the incorrect mollify-then-correct scheme. The current proof method, while reaching the correct conclusion, is not a valid argument because (a) the Moser trick does not apply to degenerate forms (see separate challenge), and (b) the intermediate claims about alpha_epsilon and its O(epsilon) bound are vacuously wrong (alpha_epsilon = 0 exactly).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
