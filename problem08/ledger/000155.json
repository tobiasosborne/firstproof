A classical result from harmonic analysis says r^2 * g(theta) is C^infinity at the origin if and only if the Fourier expansion of g contains only modes |n| \u003c= 2 with n = 0 mod 2 (i.e., modes n = -2, 0, +2). The angular partition of unity rho_i(theta) is a generic smooth function, and the products rho_i(theta)*q_i(theta) introduce all even Fourier modes (n = +-4, +-6, ...) plus generically odd modes. For the gamma=0 case, g(theta) = (1/4)[(rho_1-rho_3) + (rho_2-rho_4)*cos(2theta)]. The product rho_2(theta)*cos(2theta) has Fourier modes that include n=+-4, +-6, etc. (since rho_2 is a bump supported in one quadrant). Thus r^2*g(theta) is NOT C^2 at the origin. Explicit counterexample: the cos(4theta) Fourier component of g gives a term r^2*cos(4theta) = (x^4-6x^2y^2+y^4)/(x^2+y^2), which is C^0 but not C^2. The proof's claim that 'homogeneity degree 2 implies smooth extension' is FALSE in general — it requires the additional constraint that only the lowest Fourier modes appear.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
