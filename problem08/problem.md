# Problem 8: Lagrangian Smoothing of Polyhedral Lagrangian Surfaces

**Field:** Symplectic Geometry

**Author:** Mohammed Abouzaid (Stanford University)

## Setup

### Polyhedral Lagrangian Surface

A **polyhedral Lagrangian surface K** in ℝ⁴ is a finite polyhedral complex all of whose faces are Lagrangians, and which is a topological submanifold of ℝ⁴.

### Lagrangian Smoothing

A **Lagrangian smoothing** of K is a Hamiltonian isotopy K_t of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds, parametrized by (0, 1], extending to a topological isotopy parametrized by [0, 1], with endpoint K₀ = K.

## Question

Let K be a polyhedral Lagrangian surface with the property that exactly **4 faces meet at every vertex**.

Does K necessarily have a **Lagrangian smoothing**?

## Key Concepts

- **ℝ⁴ with standard symplectic structure**: ℝ⁴ equipped with the symplectic form ω = dx₁ ∧ dy₁ + dx₂ ∧ dy₂.
- **Lagrangian submanifold**: A 2-dimensional submanifold L of ℝ⁴ such that ω|_L = 0. Lagrangian submanifolds have dimension equal to half the ambient dimension.
- **Polyhedral complex**: A complex built from flat (affine) pieces, glued along their boundaries.
- **Lagrangian face**: Each face of the polyhedral complex is an affine 2-plane in ℝ⁴ on which the symplectic form vanishes.
- **Hamiltonian isotopy**: A smooth family of diffeomorphisms generated by Hamiltonian vector fields. A Hamiltonian isotopy of Lagrangian submanifolds preserves the Lagrangian condition.
- **Topological isotopy**: A continuous family of homeomorphisms.
- **4 faces at every vertex**: This is a combinatorial condition on the polyhedral complex, restricting the local geometry at each vertex.

## Constraints

The proof should be roughly five pages or fewer.
