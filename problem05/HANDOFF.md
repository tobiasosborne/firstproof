# Problem 05 HANDOFF — Slice Filtration for Incomplete Transfer Systems

## Session 1 Summary

**Problem:** Fix a finite group G and an incomplete transfer system O associated to an N_infinity operad. (1) Define the O-slice filtration on the G-equivariant stable category. (2) State and prove a characterization of O-slice connectivity of a connective G-spectrum in terms of geometric fixed points.

**Status:** Proof tree created (11 nodes), verification wave 1 complete. **All 10 child nodes challenged. 45 open challenges (18 critical, 17 major, 8 minor, 2 missing-dep-only).**

## Critical Blocking Issues (Priority Order)

### 1. F_O DEFINITION COLLAPSE (Node 1.1) — HIGHEST PRIORITY
The definition Sub_O^tr(G) = {H <= G : tr_H^G in O} always includes G (since tr_G^G = identity is in every transfer system). Taking the family generated by {G} yields Sub(G) = all subgroups. Therefore **F_O = Sub(G) for EVERY transfer system O**, making the entire generalization vacuous.

**Impact:** Propagates to ALL downstream nodes. The "O-slice filtration" is just the standard HHR regular slice filtration regardless of O.

**Possible repairs (none validated yet):**
- Use norms instead of transfers: F_O = {H <= G : norm N_H^G exists in O}
- Use proper subgroups only: Sub_O^tr(G) = {H < G : tr_H^G in O}
- Skip family generation; use Sub_O^tr(G) directly (but then induction in 1.8 breaks)
- Define admissibility via the lattice structure of O using Rubin's classification
- **Warning:** naive fix of excluding G breaks the complete-transfer-system boundary case (verified for G = C_p by verifier-9)

### 2. WRONG GEOMETRIC FP FORMULA (Node 1.5)
Phi^H(G_+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K}) != S^m in general. By double coset formula:
```
Phi^H(G_+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K}) = bigvee_{[g] in H\G/K, H <= gKg^{-1}} S^{m*[gKg^{-1}:H]}
```
The node claims S^m but the correct answer is a wedge of spheres of dimension m*[gKg^{-1}:H]. Only equals S^m when H is conjugate to K (not merely subconjugate).

**Counterexample:** G = S_3, K = S_3, H = C_2: result is S^{3m}, not S^m.

### 3. LOCALIZING VS COLOCALIZING (Node 1.3)
tau_O^{>=n} = {X : [Sigma, X]^G = 0 for all cells Sigma} is a RIGHT perpendicular = COLOCALIZING subcategory, not localizing. The connective cover P_O^n is a right adjoint from colocalization (cellularization), not left adjoint from Bousfield localization.

### 4. HAUSDORFF FAILURE (Node 1.3)
For a genuinely incomplete transfer system (if F_O is ever properly fixed), the O-slice cells may not detect all nonzero G-spectra. A spectrum with Phi^K(X) != 0 only for K not in F_O would be invisible. The Hausdorff property fails in general.

### 5. REGULAR VS GENERAL SLICE CELLS (Node 1.2)
Node 1.2 defines only regular slice cells (G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H}) but claims to define "standard HHR slice cells." The standard HHR slice cells use ALL representations V, not just regular representation multiples. The complete boundary case (node 1.4) recovers the regular HHR filtration, not the standard one.

### 6. RO(H)-GRADED TO INTEGER-GRADED GAP (Nodes 1.7, 1.8)
Both proof directions require transitioning between RO(H)-graded homotopy groups (pi_{m*rho_H}^H) and integer-graded geometric fixed points (pi_k(Phi^H)). Neither node provides any argument for this step, which is the core technical content of the HHR proof.

### 7. NO PROOF CONTENT (Nodes 1.3, 1.7, 1.8)
These nodes are leaf nodes containing only proof sketches. They need to be refined into children with actual mathematical arguments.

### 8. MISSING DEPENDENCIES (All nodes)
No node declares any dependencies. Taint propagation is completely broken.

## What Was Done This Session

1. Generated 3 competing proof strategies via subagents (HHR-style, operadic/categorical, geometric-fixed-points-first)
2. Synthesized hybrid strategy and registered 10 child nodes under root
3. Added 5 definitions and 6 external references
4. Completed full breadth-first verification wave (10 verifier agents, nodes 1.1-1.10)
5. All nodes challenged; 45 challenges registered

## Next Session Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix the F_O definition (BLOCKING)
1. Claim node 1.1 as prover
2. Research the correct extraction of a family from a transfer system (consult Blumberg-Hill 2015 Section 5, Rubin 2021 Theorem 3.7, and the HHR slice cell construction)
3. The key question: what EXACTLY determines which slice cells appear in the O-restricted setting? The answer likely involves the indexing system associated to O, not just which transfers exist to G
4. Resolve all 4 challenges on node 1.1 with a repaired definition
5. Verify the repair against G = C_p (both transfer systems must give different families)

### Phase 2: Cascade repairs through 1.2-1.6
- Fix regular vs general slice cells (1.2)
- Fix localizing/colocalizing (1.3)
- Address Hausdorff failure (1.3)
- Fix boundary cases (1.4)
- Fix geometric FP formula (1.5)
- Fix connectivity convention (1.6)

### Phase 3: Write actual proofs (1.7, 1.8)
- Refine 1.7 and 1.8 into children with detailed arguments
- The RO(H)-to-integer transition is the key technical lemma

### Phase 4: Declare all dependencies and re-verify

## Lessons Learned
1. **Family generation from {G} is always Sub(G).** Any definition of "O-admissible subgroups" that includes G and takes family closure will collapse. This is the #1 pitfall.
2. **Transfers != norms.** The slice filtration cares about multiplicative norms, not additive transfers. The Blumberg-Hill correspondence relates them, but the extraction of the relevant family requires care.
3. **Regular != general slice cells.** Must be explicit about which variant is being used.
4. **Right perpendicular = colocalizing.** The slice filtration construction uses colocalization (cellularization), not Bousfield localization.
5. **Double coset formula gives wedges.** Phi^H of an induced spectrum is not a single sphere but a wedge indexed by double cosets.
