# Problem 5: Slice Filtration for Incomplete Transfer Systems

**Field:** Algebraic Topology / Equivariant Homotopy Theory

**Author:** Andrew J. Blumberg (Columbia University)

## Setup

Fix a **finite group G**.

Let **𝒪** denote an **incomplete transfer system** associated to an N_∞ operad.

## Question

1. **Define** the slice filtration on the G-equivariant stable category adapted to 𝒪.

2. **State and prove** a characterization of the 𝒪-slice connectivity of a connective G-spectrum in terms of the geometric fixed points.

## Key Concepts

- **Finite group G**: A group with finitely many elements, acting on spectra.
- **G-equivariant stable category**: The stable homotopy category of G-spectra, where objects are spectra with a G-action and morphisms are equivariant maps up to stable equivalence.
- **N_∞ operad**: An equivariant generalization of E_∞ operads that encodes partial transfer (norm) structures. Different N_∞ operads correspond to different subsets of allowed transfer maps.
- **Incomplete transfer system 𝒪**: A combinatorial object associated to an N_∞ operad, specifying which transfer maps are available. It is a subcategory of the orbit category of G.
- **Slice filtration**: A filtration on G-spectra generalizing the Postnikov filtration to the equivariant setting. The standard slice filtration uses the regular slice cells; the question asks to adapt this to the incomplete transfer system 𝒪.
- **𝒪-slice connectivity**: The connectivity condition on a G-spectrum with respect to the 𝒪-adapted slice filtration.
- **Connective G-spectrum**: A G-spectrum X such that the underlying non-equivariant homotopy groups πₖ(X) vanish for k < 0.
- **Geometric fixed points Φ^H(X)**: For a subgroup H ≤ G, the geometric fixed points of X, a non-equivariant spectrum obtained by a specific fixed-point construction that commutes with smash products and suspensions.

## Constraints

The proof should be roughly five pages or fewer.
