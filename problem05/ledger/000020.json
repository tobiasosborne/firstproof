Prove: Phi^H(G_+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K}) = S^m when H is subconjugate to K (specifically when (H) is conjugate to a subgroup of K), and = 0 when no conjugate of H is a subgroup of K. The key dimensional identity is: Phi^H(S^{m*rho_H}) = S^m since (rho_H)^H is 1-dimensional. This uses HHR Prop 3.16 and the double coset formula.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"cae66032ee069181d224224ff041aeaf1d4572c0babd94c596886fa7f6dc37b9","created":"2026-02-10T19:23:25.338624784Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
