By the double coset formula (HHR Prop 3.16), Phi^H(G_+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K}) = bigvee_{[g] in H\\G/K, H \u003c= gKg^{-1}} S^{m * dim((g*rho_K)^H)}. The key point: (g*rho_K)^H when H \u003c= gKg^{-1} has dimension [gKg^{-1}:H], NOT 1. The regular representation rho_K of K, conjugated to gKg^{-1} and then restricted to H and taking H-fixed-points, gives a space of dimension [gKg^{-1}:H] (the number of H-cosets in gKg^{-1}). So each summand is S^{m*[gKg^{-1}:H]}, not S^m. The result is S^m ONLY when H is CONJUGATE to K (index = 1, single double coset). COUNTEREXAMPLE: Let G = S_3, K = S_3, H = C_2 (a subgroup). Then H is subconjugate to K but Phi^{C_2}(S_3+ smash_{S_3} S^{m*rho_{S_3}}) = Phi^{C_2}(S^{m*rho_{S_3}}) = S^{m*[S_3:C_2]} = S^{3m}, not S^m. The node conflates subconjugate (H contained in a conjugate of K) with conjugate (H equal to a conjugate of K).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
