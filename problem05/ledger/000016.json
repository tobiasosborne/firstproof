Given a transfer system O on G, let Sub_O^tr(G) = {H \u003c= G : tr_H^G is in O}. Define F_O as the family of subgroups generated by Sub_O^tr(G), i.e., the smallest collection closed under subconjugacy and conjugation containing Sub_O^tr(G). Prove that F_O is well-defined and is a family of subgroups of G. [Key insight from Strategy C: Sub_O^tr(G) itself may NOT be closed under taking subgroups for general incomplete transfer systems, so the family generation step is essential.]","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"79f4b70ae09d6dcc8f0680aae5226f93191732d6f1a068bf0addd77c0069cb52","created":"2026-02-10T19:23:25.338613987Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
