Node 1.2 has 3 open challenges (only regular cells defined, dimension gaps, missing dependency on 1.1). Node 1.3 has 6 open challenges (localizing vs colocalizing error, mapping space ambiguity, Hausdorff failure, exhaustiveness unproved, missing dependencies, no proof content).\n\nWithout declared dependencies:\n- Taint propagation is broken: if 1.1's F_O definition changes, 1.6 should automatically be re-evaluated but won't be.\n- The theorem's meaning is entirely determined by definitions in 1.1-1.3, so it cannot be validated independently.\n- The accumulated 13 open challenges across nodes 1.1-1.3 all propagate to affect the meaning and correctness of this theorem, but the dependency graph does not reflect this.\n\nThe node must declare explicit dependencies on at least nodes 1.1 (for F_O), 1.2 (for O-slice cells), and 1.3 (for the O-slice filtration and the meaning of 'O-slice \u003e= n').","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
