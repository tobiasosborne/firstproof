Assume X is connective and Phi^H(X) is floor(n/|H|)-connected for all H in F_O. We must show [Sigma, X]^G = 0 for all O-slice cells Sigma of dim \u003c n. Proceed by induction on |H| (ascending). Base case H = e: pi_k(X) = pi_k(Phi^e(X)) = 0 for k \u003c n. Inductive step: use the isotropy separation long exact sequence and tom Dieck splitting. The splitting introduces subgroups K \u003c H; since F_O is a family (closed under subgroups), K is in F_O, so the inductive hypothesis applies. This is the hardest step and the reason for defining F_O as a family rather than just Sub_O^tr(G).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"1010c3686cb96ca24f011000e030965cc4ada96236d5ac116b0a591b503bda14","created":"2026-02-10T19:23:25.338633781Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
