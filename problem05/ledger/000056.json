{"type":"challenge_raised","timestamp":"2026-02-10T20:45:29.829160646Z","challenge_id":"ch-65f8a474237e6b3a","node_id":"1.6","target":"statement","reason":"O-INDEPENDENCE DUE TO F_O COLLAPSE: Node 1.1 has the critical open challenge (ch-88eb381843e786c4) showing that F_O collapses to Sub(G) for EVERY transfer system O. Since G is always in Sub_O^tr(G) (because tr_G^G is the identity and always belongs to O), and a family must be closed under taking subgroups, F_O = Sub(G) regardless of O.\n\nThis means the theorem as stated quantifies 'for every subgroup H in F_O' which is simply 'for every subgroup H of G' -- the same condition for every transfer system O. The theorem becomes:\n\n'A connective G-spectrum X is O-slice \u003e= n iff for every subgroup H of G, Phi^H(X) is floor(n/|H|)-connected.'\n\nBut wait: the left-hand side still says 'O-slice \u003e= n', which references the O-slice cells (node 1.2) restricted to subgroups in F_O. With F_O = Sub(G), the O-slice cells are IDENTICAL to the standard HHR regular slice cells for EVERY O. Therefore 'O-slice \u003e= n' = 'regular slice \u003e= n' for every O.\n\nConsequently, the entire theorem is just the standard HHR Regular Slice Theorem (Theorem 4.42) wearing different notation. It says nothing about the transfer system O; it is O-independent. The theorem is not wrong per se, but it is VACUOUS as a generalization -- it does not extend HHR to incomplete transfer systems in any meaningful way.\n\nThe theorem statement SHOULD depend on a corrected definition of F_O (one that genuinely depends on O) from node 1.1. Until node 1.1's critical challenges are resolved, this theorem statement is at best the standard HHR result rebranded, and at worst, it will need to be completely rewritten once F_O is properly defined.\n\nNode 1.6 cannot be accepted until the F_O definition in node 1.1 is fixed, because the theorem's meaning depends entirely on what F_O is.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
