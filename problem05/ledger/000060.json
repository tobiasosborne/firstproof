However, node 1.5 declares NO dependencies. It should depend on nodes 1.1 and 1.2. This is a structural deficiency: if the definition of slice cells in 1.2 changes (and 1.2 already has open challenges about regular vs. general slice cells), the computation here may need revision.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
