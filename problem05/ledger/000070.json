The node claims to use 'induction on |H| (descending)' but does not explain why descending is correct. In the isotropy separation cofiber sequence EF[H]_+ /\\ X -\u003e X -\u003e tilde{E}F[H] /\\ X, taking H-geometric-fixed-points yields Phi^H(X) = (tilde{E}F[H] /\\ X)^H. The term (EF[H]_+ /\\ X)^H involves information about PROPER subgroups of H (since EF[H] is built from cells with isotropy K where H is not subconjugate to K). In a descending induction, when you handle H = G first, the EF[G]_+ /\\ X term involves proper subgroups K \u003c G, for which you have NOT yet established vanishing of pi_k(Phi^K(X)). So the induction does not close. SPECIFICALLY: For H = G, (EF[G]_+)^G is contractible (since no proper subgroup of G contains G as a subgroup), so the map X^G -\u003e Phi^G(X) is an equivalence and one can potentially argue directly. But for general H \u003c G, the isotropy separation for Phi^H involves subgroups K with K \u003c H AND also information about subgroups containing H, depending on the precise family used. The node must: (1) Specify exactly which family F is used in the cofiber sequence for each H. (2) Explain why the induction closes (what is the inductive hypothesis, and why is it available at each step). (3) Clarify whether the induction is on ALL subgroups or only those in F_O. Without these details, the induction argument is a black box that may not work.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
