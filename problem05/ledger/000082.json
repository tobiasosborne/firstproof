Its statement explicitly references nodes 1.1-1.3 (for the O-slice filtration definition) and nodes 1.6-1.8 (for the O-Slice Connectivity Theorem and its proof). It also implicitly depends on node 1.4 (functoriality/monotonicity), node 1.5 (geometric fixed points computation), and node 1.9 (test case verification).\n\nYet the node declares ZERO dependencies. This is a fundamental structural error for a QED node:\n\n(1) A QED node by definition assembles all prior results. Its correctness is ENTIRELY derivative — it is valid if and only if ALL upstream nodes are valid. Without declared dependencies, the proof tree's taint propagation mechanism cannot function: if any upstream node is refuted or modified, the QED should automatically be flagged, but without dependency links, it remains silently \"pending.\"\n\n(2) The af framework requires explicit dependency declaration for logical soundness of the proof tree. A QED node with no dependencies is logically equivalent to an unsupported assertion — it claims the proof is complete without formally linking to any of the components.\n\n(3) The node MUST depend on at least nodes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9. In fact, every leaf node in the proof tree should ultimately feed into the QED through the dependency chain.\n\nThis must be fixed by adding explicit dependencies on all nine upstream nodes.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
