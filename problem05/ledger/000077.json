The node claims to use 'induction on |H| (descending)' with the isotropy separation cofiber sequence. In the inductive step for a given H in F_O, the isotropy separation sequence EF[H]_+ /\\ X -\u003e X -\u003e tilde{E}F[H] /\\ X introduces homotopy groups of (EF[H]_+ /\\ X)^H. The spectrum EF[H]_+ /\\ X has isotropy in the family F[H] = {K : H is not subconjugate to K}, and its H-fixed points involve information about PROPER subgroups K \u003c H. By the tom Dieck splitting (or direct analysis), pi_*^H(EF[H]_+ /\\ X) involves Phi^K(X) for subgroups K properly contained in H. The inductive hypothesis (for the descending induction) would give vanishing of pi_k(Phi^K(X)) for K properly containing H (larger subgroups), but what is needed is information about K \u003c H (smaller subgroups). This suggests the induction direction is WRONG and should be ASCENDING on |H| (handling small H first, then using that for larger H). But even if the induction direction is corrected, there is a further problem: the proper subgroups K \u003c H that arise in the isotropy separation may NOT be in F_O. The hypothesis pi_{m*rho_K}^K(X) = 0 is only available for K in F_O. If a proper subgroup K \u003c H is not in F_O, the inductive hypothesis does not apply to K, creating a gap. The node must either: (a) prove that for H in F_O, all relevant subgroups K appearing in the induction are also in F_O (this follows from F_O being a family, but must be stated), or (b) handle the case where K is not in F_O separately.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
