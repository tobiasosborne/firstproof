The O-slice cells defined in node 1.2 are SC_O(n) = {G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H} : H in F_O, m|H| = n}. These use ONLY multiples of the regular representation rho_H. Even when O is the complete transfer system so F_O = Sub(G), the resulting cells are precisely the REGULAR slice cells (HHR Definition 4.23), not the FULL slice cells.\n\nThe standard HHR slice filtration (HHR Definition 4.2 / Theorem 4.42) uses ALL slice cells G_+ smash_H S^V for all representations V of H with dim(V^H) = n, not just V = m*rho_H. The regular representation is one specific choice.\n\nThe REGULAR slice filtration and the GENERAL slice filtration are genuinely different. They agree for some groups and spectra but not in general. The regular slice filtration has the property that achievable cell dimensions are restricted to {m|H| : H \u003c= G, m \u003e= 0}, while the general slice filtration has cells in every integer dimension.\n\nHHR Section 4.4 introduces the regular slice filtration separately from the general one precisely because they are distinct. The regular slice filtration has better computational properties but coarser information.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement should be: 'O = complete transfer system recovers the REGULAR slice filtration of HHR,' not the standard one. This was already identified as a critical challenge on node 1.2 (ch-a3b2aa31ce35f322). Node 1.4 inherits this error.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
