The node claims this follows from isotropy separation and tom Dieck splitting but provides no details. Specifically:\n\n(1) ISOTROPY SEPARATION: The cofiber sequence EF_+ smash X -\u003e X -\u003e tilde{EF} smash X yields a long exact sequence relating pi_{m*rho_H}^H(X) to pi_{m*rho_H}^H(EF_+ smash X) and pi_{m*rho_H}^H(tilde{EF} smash X). The geometric fixed point piece Phi^H(X) relates to the last term, but the passage from pi_{m*rho_H}^H(tilde{EF} smash X) to pi_m(Phi^H(X)) requires detailed analysis of RO(H)-graded homotopy of the geometric fixed point functor. This is not provided.\n\n(2) TOM DIECK SPLITTING: This applies to SUSPENSION SPECTRA, giving a direct sum decomposition. For a GENERAL connective G-spectrum X (not a suspension spectrum), no such simple splitting exists. The EF_+ smash X piece must be analyzed via a spectral sequence or homotopy limit, and the node does not indicate how.\n\n(3) THE KEY MISSING ARGUMENT: Even in HHR (Section 4.4, Theorem 4.42), the analogous step requires approximately a page of dense equivariant stable homotopy theory. The claim that this reduces to 'use isotropy separation and tom Dieck' without further detail is a critical gap. The node needs children implementing: (a) the precise isotropy separation long exact sequence being used, (b) how the inductive hypothesis for K \u003c H feeds into the EF_+ smash X piece, (c) the passage from RO(H)-graded to integer-graded for the geometric fixed point piece, and (d) the connectivity bookkeeping showing the bounds work out.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
