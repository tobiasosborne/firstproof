The standard definition of a family of subgroups requires closure under:\n(1) Conjugation: if H is in F and g is in G, then gHg^{-1} is in F.\n(2) Taking subgroups: if H is in F and K \u003c= H, then K is in F.\n\nThe term 'subconjugacy' typically means the relation H \u003c=_G K iff H is subconjugate to K, i.e., some conjugate of H is a subgroup of K. Closure under subconjugacy already implies closure under both conjugation and taking subgroups, so listing both 'subconjugacy and conjugation' is redundant.\n\nMore importantly, the standard term in equivariant homotopy theory is simply 'family of subgroups' with the two closure conditions above. The use of 'subconjugacy' without precise definition introduces potential for confusion, especially since some authors use the term differently.\n\nThis is a minor terminological issue but should be clarified for precision.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
