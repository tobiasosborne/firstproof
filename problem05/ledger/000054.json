This is the standard convention in HHR (Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel), Schwede, and all major references in equivariant stable homotopy theory.\n\nUnder this convention:\n- Statement (A) says: pi_j(Phi^H(X)) = 0 for all j \u003c= floor(n/|H|).\n- Statement (B) says: pi_k(Phi^H(X)) = 0 for all k \u003c floor(n/|H|), which is equivalent to pi_j = 0 for j \u003c= floor(n/|H|) - 1, i.e., (floor(n/|H|) - 1)-connected.\n\nSo (A) claims floor(n/|H|)-connectedness while (B) claims (floor(n/|H|) - 1)-connectedness. These differ by exactly 1.\n\nWHICH IS CORRECT? In HHR Theorem 4.42 (the Regular Slice Theorem), the statement is: a connective G-spectrum X is regular slice \u003e= n iff for all H \u003c= G, Phi^H(X) is (floor(n/|H|) - 1)-connected, meaning pi_k(Phi^H(X)) = 0 for k \u003c= floor(n/|H|) - 1 (equivalently, for k \u003c floor(n/|H|)). So the PARENTHETICAL (B) appears to match HHR, but the VERBAL DESCRIPTION (A) does not.\n\nHowever, there is a further subtlety: some sources define k-connected as pi_j = 0 for j \u003c k (rather than j \u003c= k). Under THAT convention, (A) and (B) would agree but both would disagree with HHR. The node must:\n(1) Fix the internal contradiction between (A) and (B).\n(2) State which connectivity convention is being used.\n(3) Verify the bound matches HHR Theorem 4.42 exactly.\n\nThis is critical because an off-by-one error in the connectivity bound would make the entire biconditional false.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
