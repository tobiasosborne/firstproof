For the O-admissible family F_O, the O-slice cells of dimension n are SC_O(n) = {G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H} : H in F_O, m*|H| = n, m \u003e= 0}, where rho_H is the regular representation of H. These restrict the standard HHR slice cells to orbits G/H with H in F_O. Verify these are compact objects in Sp^G.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"7acf5cbef926d741783101b39f5b892c3e827999fe745c57c632c06fb73e60fb","created":"2026-02-10T19:23:25.33861768Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
