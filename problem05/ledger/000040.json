This is the RIGHT PERPENDICULAR of the set of O-slice cells of dimension \u003c n. In a stable category, the right perpendicular S^perp = {X : [C, X] = 0 for all C in S} of a set of objects S is closed under PRODUCTS, LIMITS, and EXTENSIONS, but NOT necessarily under COLIMITS. It is therefore a COLOCALIZING subcategory, not a localizing subcategory as claimed in part (a).\n\nA LOCALIZING subcategory is one closed under colimits (in particular coproducts) and extensions. The LEFT PERPENDICULAR {}^perp S = {X : [X, C] = 0 for all C in S} would be localizing. The node has the direction backwards.\n\nCONCRETE VERIFICATION: In the standard HHR slice filtration (HHR Section 4), the slice sections tau^{\u003e=n} are defined as the full subcategory of spectra X such that [Sigma, X]^G = 0 for certain cells Sigma. HHR establish this is the ACYCLICS of a localization functor, or equivalently, the class of LOCAL objects for the localization. In Hovey-Palmieri-Strickland's framework, the local objects (= right perpendicular objects) form a colocalizing subcategory.\n\nThis error propagates to part (b): Bousfield LOCALIZATION gives a LEFT adjoint to the inclusion of LOCAL OBJECTS. But the node claims P_O^n is a RIGHT adjoint. If tau_O^{\u003e=n} is the class of local objects for a Bousfield localization, then the localization functor L is a LEFT adjoint to the inclusion. If instead P_O^n is meant to be a COLOCALIZATION (= right adjoint = connective cover), then the construction is Bousfield COLOCALIZATION (cellularization), not localization.\n\nThe node must clarify: (1) Is tau_O^{\u003e=n} a localizing or colocalizing subcategory? (2) Is the construction Bousfield localization or Bousfield colocalization/cellularization? (3) Is P_O^n a left or right adjoint? These three questions are tightly linked and the current statement is internally inconsistent.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
