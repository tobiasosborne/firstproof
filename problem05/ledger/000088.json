If the O-slice filtration varies with O (as intended), the relationship between different filtrations for different transfer systems is a key structural result. Node 1.4 is not mentioned in the QED assembly.\n\n(2) NODE 1.5 (Geometric fixed points of O-slice cells): The computation Phi^H(G+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K}) is used in BOTH the forward direction (node 1.7) and the reverse direction (node 1.8) of the proof. This is a crucial lemma that the QED should explicitly invoke when assembling the proof. Its omission means the QED does not properly account for all components needed to make the proof work.\n\n(3) NODE 1.9 (Test case verification): While test cases are not strictly part of the proof, node 1.9 self-identified a critical definitional tension (F_O collapses for the trivial transfer system) that affects the validity of the ENTIRE proof. A complete QED assembly should reference this sanity check and its conclusions.\n\nFurthermore, the proof summary as stated is too vague to serve as a proper QED:\n- \"Define F_O from O\" — but the definition is broken (F_O = Sub(G) always).\n- \"Define O-slice cells restricted to F_O\" — but only regular cells are defined.\n- \"Construct filtration by Bousfield localization\" — but localizing vs colocalizing is confused.\n- \"Characterize O-slice \u003e= n connectivity by the geometric fixed point condition\" — but the geometric FP formula is wrong, the connectivity convention has an off-by-one error, and neither proof direction (1.7, 1.8) contains actual proof content.\n\nThe QED should be a precise enumeration of which lemma feeds where, with explicit dependency chains, not a vague narrative summary.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
