As a consequence, the QED's claimed theorem is:\n\n\"A connective G-spectrum X is O-slice \u003e= n iff for every H \u003c= G, Phi^H(X) is floor(n/|H|)-connected.\"\n\nSince the O-slice cells are also O-independent (all transfer systems give the same cells because F_O = Sub(G) always), the left-hand side \"O-slice \u003e= n\" is also O-independent. The entire theorem reduces to:\n\n\"A connective G-spectrum X is regular-slice \u003e= n iff for every H \u003c= G, Phi^H(X) is floor(n/|H|)-connected.\"\n\nThis is (up to the off-by-one issue in node 1.6) precisely HHR Theorem 4.42, the standard Regular Slice Theorem. The proof tree has not established anything NEW about incomplete transfer systems. The \"O-\" prefix throughout the entire proof tree is vacuous decoration that adds no mathematical content.\n\nFor the QED to claim a genuine generalization, the F_O definition must first be fixed so that different transfer systems O produce genuinely different families F_O, different slice cells, and different filtrations. Until then, the QED is at best a restatement of existing theory, not a new result.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
