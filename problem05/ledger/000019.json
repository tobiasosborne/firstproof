Show the assignment O -\u003e tau_O^{\u003e=*} is order-preserving: if O is a sub-transfer-system of O-prime (fewer transfers), then tau_{O}^{\u003e=n} contains tau_{O-prime}^{\u003e=n}. Verify boundary cases: O = complete transfer system recovers the standard HHR slice filtration; O = trivial (minimal) transfer system recovers a coarse filtration indexed by multiples of |G| where only H = G contributes.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"ae70b737381040267be57776834a7d56dfb3f440e07ba0f376f8bbdb700eaf02","created":"2026-02-10T19:23:25.338623363Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
