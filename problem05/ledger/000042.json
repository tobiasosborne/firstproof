However, the correct definition for the slice filtration in HHR uses the vanishing of ALL mapping groups: [Sigma^k Sigma_cell, X]^G = 0 for all k, i.e., the mapping spectrum Map(Sigma, X) must be contractible, not merely that pi_0 Map(Sigma, X) = 0.\n\nMore precisely, in HHR's framework (Definition 4.1-4.5), a G-spectrum X is slice \u003e= n if it is in the right perpendicular category S^perp where S is the set of O-slice cells of dimension \u003c n. The right perpendicular is defined by the condition that Map(Sigma, X) is contractible (equivalently, [Sigma[k], X]^G = 0 for all integers k, where Sigma[k] = Sigma^k wedge Sigma, the k-fold suspension).\n\nThe condition [Sigma, X]^G = 0 (only pi_0) is STRICTLY WEAKER than Map(Sigma, X) being contractible (all homotopy groups). Using only pi_0 would give a larger subcategory than the correct slice section category. For example, there could exist X with [Sigma, X]^G = 0 but [Sigma^{-1} Sigma, X]^G = [Sigma, Sigma X]^G nonzero (i.e., some negative-dimensional mapping is nontrivial).\n\nHOWEVER: there is a subtlety. In HHR, because the cells are COMPACT and the category is stable, one often works with [Sigma, X]^G as a graded group (i.e., the full graded homotopy group [Sigma, X]^G_* = pi_* Map(Sigma, X)). The notation [Sigma, X]^G in the node is ambiguous: does it mean (a) the abelian group pi_0(Map^G(Sigma, X)), or (b) the graded group pi_*(Map^G(Sigma, X))? If it means (b), the definition is correct but the notation is misleading. If (a), the definition is wrong. The node must clarify this.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
