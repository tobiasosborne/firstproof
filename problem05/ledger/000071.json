Node 1.7 uses multiple concepts defined in earlier nodes but declares NO dependencies: (1) F_O (the O-admissible family) from node 1.1, which has 4 open challenges including the critical collapse-to-Sub(G) issue. If F_O = Sub(G) for all O, then this forward direction is just the standard HHR forward direction. (2) The O-slice cells from node 1.2, needed to interpret what 'O-slice \u003e= n' means. Node 1.2 has 3 open challenges. (3) The definition of 'O-slice \u003e= n' from node 1.3, which has 6 open challenges including the localizing-vs-colocalizing error and the mapping-groups-pi_0-vs-contractible ambiguity. The correct interpretation of [Sigma, X]^G = 0 (is it pi_0 of the mapping spectrum, or contractibility of the mapping spectrum?) directly affects what hypothesis node 1.7 starts with. (4) The geometric fixed points computation from node 1.5, which has 4 open challenges including the incorrect formula Phi^H(G_+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K}) = S^m (should involve wedges of higher-dimensional spheres via the double coset formula). Node 1.7 implicitly uses the relationship between O-slice cells and geometric fixed points. Without declared dependencies, taint propagation cannot function: if any upstream definition is refuted, node 1.7 should be automatically flagged for re-evaluation.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
