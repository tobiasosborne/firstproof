This suggestion is mathematically imprecise and has not been checked for correctness.\n\nSpecific deficiencies in the proposed fix:\n\n(1) WHAT DOES 'norm N_H^G is in O' MEAN? A transfer system O in the Blumberg-Hill sense is a wide subcategory of the Burnside category (or a combinatorial object recording which pairs (H,K) have transfers). The 'norm N_H^G' is a multiplicative operation in equivariant homotopy theory, related to the transfer via the Blumberg-Hill correspondence but NOT directly an element of the transfer system. The node must specify whether it means: (a) the pair (H,G) is in O as a transfer system entry (which is the SAME as tr_H^G being in O, making this circular), or (b) the N_infinity operad structure includes the H-to-G norm (which is equivalent to (a) by the Blumberg-Hill correspondence), or (c) something different from both of these.\n\n(2) DOES THE FIX ACTUALLY WORK? Even if we redefine Sub_O^norm(G) = {H \u003c G : the norm N_H^G is available in O} (excluding G itself by using strict inequality), we still need to take the family generated by this set. If ANY subgroup H with |H| \u003e 1 is in Sub_O^norm, then {H} generates the family of all subgroups of H and their conjugates. For incomplete transfer systems where some norms are present, this could still collapse to large families. The node does not verify that the alternative definition gives non-trivial families for non-trivial transfer systems.\n\n(3) MUST CHECK BOTH EXTREME CASES: Under any proposed alternative definition, one must verify: (a) For O = complete transfer system, the definition still gives F_O = Sub(G), recovering HHR. (b) For O = trivial transfer system, the definition gives F_O = {e} (or some other non-trivial minimal family). The node proposes the fix but does not verify either extreme case under it.\n\n(4) INTERPLAY WITH NODE 1.1: Node 1.1 defines F_O using transfers (tr_H^G in O). Node 1.9 suggests the definition should use norms instead. If the fix is adopted, node 1.1 must be completely rewritten, and all downstream nodes (1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8) must be re-verified with the new definition. The node does not acknowledge the scope of the proposed change.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
