Unpacking: X = 0 iff [Sigma, X]^G = 0 for ALL O-slice cells Sigma of ALL dimensions. This is equivalent to saying: the O-slice cells GENERATE Sp^G as a localizing subcategory (i.e., no nonzero X is perpendicular to all O-slice cells).\n\nFor the STANDARD HHR slice filtration with the complete transfer system, the slice cells include G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H} for ALL subgroups H of G and all m \u003e= 0. These generate Sp^G because: (1) for H = e, we get S^m (integer spheres), which detect non-equivariant homotopy, and (2) the cells for all subgroups H detect all geometric fixed points. The combination of all geometric fixed point functors is jointly conservative on Sp^G.\n\nHowever, for an INCOMPLETE transfer system O, the O-slice cells only involve subgroups H in F_O. If F_O is a PROPER subfamily of Sub(G), then there exist subgroups K not in F_O. The O-slice cells cannot detect information about Phi^K(X) for such K. Consequently, there could exist nonzero X with Phi^K(X) nonzero only for K not in F_O, and such X would satisfy [Sigma, X]^G = 0 for all O-slice cells Sigma. This X would be in tau_O^{\u003e=n} for all n, violating Hausdorff-ness.\n\nCONCRETE COUNTEREXAMPLE: Let G = C_4 and let O be a transfer system where only trivial transfers are available (minimal O). If the definition of F_O is eventually corrected so that F_O is a proper family (say F_O = {e, C_4} only), then consider the spectrum X = G/C_2_+ (the suspension spectrum of the orbit G/C_2). The geometric fixed points Phi^{C_2}(X) are nonzero, but C_2 is not in F_O. The O-slice cells involve only H = e and H = C_4, and [G_+ smash_e S^m, X]^G = pi_m(X) and [G_+ smash_{C_4} S^{m*rho_{C_4}}, X]^G involve only e and C_4. For appropriate X, the C_2 information is invisible to these cells.\n\nThe Hausdorff claim is therefore FALSE for incomplete transfer systems where F_O is a proper family, unless additional conditions are imposed or the definition is modified. This is a fundamental obstruction to the O-slice filtration being Hausdorff when O is genuinely incomplete.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
