This is a structural error: if node 1.1 is refuted or modified (e.g., if the definition of F_O changes), node 1.2 inherits those changes silently. The node should explicitly depend on 1.1. Furthermore, node 1.1 defines F_O as the family GENERATED by Sub_O^tr(G) (closed under subconjugacy and conjugation). If 1.1 is not yet validated, the definition of F_O used here may be incorrect, and any issues with F_O propagate to the slice cells defined here.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
