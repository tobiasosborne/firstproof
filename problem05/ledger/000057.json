The statement says 'This uses HHR Prop 3.16 and the double coset formula' but does not actually APPLY the double coset formula. If it had, the error in the main formula would have been apparent. The node is a bare assertion without any reasoning. The double coset formula application requires: (1) enumerating the double cosets H\\G/K, (2) identifying which cosets [g] satisfy H \u003c= gKg^{-1}, (3) computing dim((g*rho_K)^H) for each such coset, (4) assembling the wedge. None of these steps are carried out. The node needs children implementing these steps, or at minimum a sketch of the argument.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
