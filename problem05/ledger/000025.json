Combine the definition of the O-slice filtration (nodes 1.1-1.3) with the O-Slice Connectivity Theorem and its proof (nodes 1.6-1.8). The total argument is: define F_O from O, define O-slice cells restricted to F_O, construct filtration by Bousfield localization, and characterize O-slice \u003e= n connectivity by the geometric fixed point condition Phi^H \u003e= floor(n/|H|)-connected for all H in F_O.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"500eda203bc2fb71d4fd97b0eb9ea4189888aad1a53402febdc610aa9b222bb4","created":"2026-02-10T19:23:25.338639842Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
