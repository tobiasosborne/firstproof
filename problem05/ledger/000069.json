Node 1.1 has the CRITICAL challenge ch-88eb381843e786c4 showing F_O collapses to Sub(G) for all O. If F_O = Sub(G) always, the 'O-' prefix is vacuous and this is just the standard HHR regular slice theorem reverse direction. The node should depend on 1.1 and inherit its taint.\n\n(2) DEPENDENCY ON NODE 1.2 (O-slice cells): The conclusion '[Sigma, X]^G = 0 for all O-slice cells Sigma of dim \u003c n' directly references the O-slice cells defined in node 1.2. Node 1.2 has 3 open challenges, including the critical issue that only REGULAR slice cells are defined (not general slice cells). The reverse direction proof must match the exact form of slice cells in 1.2.\n\n(3) DEPENDENCY ON NODE 1.5 (Phi^H of slice cells): The argument implicitly uses the computation of Phi^H applied to slice cells. Node 1.5 has the CRITICAL challenge ch-1bed8381882c4894 showing the Phi^H formula is wrong (gives a wedge of spheres, not a single sphere S^m, when H is a proper subgroup of K). If the Phi^H computation is wrong, the connectivity bookkeeping in 1.8 may produce incorrect bounds.\n\n(4) DEPENDENCY ON NODE 1.6 (theorem statement): Node 1.8 is proving the reverse direction of the theorem stated in 1.6. Node 1.6 has 4 open challenges including the off-by-one connectivity convention issue (ch-3136558683a060b7). If the connectivity bound in 1.6 is off by one, then 1.8 may be proving the wrong statement.\n\n(5) DEPENDENCY ON NODE 1.7 (forward direction): While 1.8 does not logically depend on 1.7, they prove opposite directions of the same biconditional. Node 1.7 uses DESCENDING induction on |H| while 1.8 uses ASCENDING. This asymmetry should be explicitly noted and justified. Moreover, both nodes should use compatible conventions for the Wirthmuller isomorphism and isotropy separation sequence.\n\nWithout declared dependencies, taint from 14+ open challenges across nodes 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.6 does not propagate to 1.8, masking the true verification status. All these dependencies must be declared.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
