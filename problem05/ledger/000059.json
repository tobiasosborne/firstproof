This identity is correct in the H-equivariant stable category (where Phi^H(S^V) = S^{V^H} for H-representations V). However, the O-slice cells as defined in node 1.2 are G_+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K} which live in the G-equivariant stable category Sp^G. The relevant computation is Phi^H(G_+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K}), NOT Phi^H(S^{m*rho_H}). The node seems to conflate these: S^{m*rho_H} is NOT a G-spectrum (unless H = G), while G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H} IS a G-spectrum. The 'key identity' Phi^H(S^{m*rho_H}) = S^m is true as an H-equivariant computation but is NOT the same as computing Phi^H of the induced G-spectrum G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H}. The node must clarify which category and which objects are involved in each formula.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
