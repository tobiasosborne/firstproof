Here is the precise argument:\n\n1. The trivial (minimal) transfer system O_min contains only the identity morphisms tr_H^H for each H \u003c= G. In particular, tr_G^G is in O_min (it is an identity morphism, and transfer systems are wide subcategories).\n\n2. By node 1.1's definition, Sub_{O_min}^tr(G) = {H \u003c= G : tr_H^G is in O_min}. Since tr_G^G is in O_min, we have G in Sub_{O_min}^tr(G).\n\n3. F_{O_min} = the family of subgroups generated by Sub_{O_min}^tr(G). Since G is in this generating set, and a family must be closed under taking subgroups, the family generated by {G} is ALL of Sub(G).\n\n4. Therefore F_{O_min} = Sub(G) = F_{O_max}. The trivial and complete transfer systems give THE SAME family.\n\n5. Consequently, the O_min-slice cells are EXACTLY the same as the O_max-slice cells: SC_{O_min}(n) = SC_{O_max}(n) = {G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H} : H \u003c= G, m|H| = n}.\n\n6. The resulting filtration tau_{O_min}^{\u003e=n} = tau_{O_max}^{\u003e=n}. It is NOT 'a coarse filtration indexed by multiples of |G| where only H = G contributes.' It is the full (regular) slice filtration with ALL subgroups contributing.\n\nThis is a direct consequence of the definitional collapse identified in the critical challenge on node 1.1 (ch-88eb381843e786c4). The F_O definition collapses to Sub(G) for every transfer system, making node 1.4's claimed boundary case distinction mathematically false.\n\nCONCRETE EXAMPLE: G = C_2 x C_2. O_min: only identity transfers. Sub_{O_min}^tr(G) = {G}. F_{O_min} = Sub(G) = all five subgroups. O_max: all transfers. F_{O_max} = Sub(G). Both give identical filtrations. The claim that O_min gives 'only H = G contributes' is false.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
