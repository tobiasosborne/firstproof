The correct inference type should reflect that this is a synthesis/combination step, not an assumption.\n\nAn assumption-type inference means the node introduces a new hypothesis accepted without proof. But a QED node should be the OPPOSITE: it should be the most heavily derived node in the tree, depending on all upstream results and introducing nothing new.\n\nThe inference type should be changed to reflect that this node follows from its dependencies (once those are declared). If the af framework supports a \"combination\" or \"qed\" inference type (distinct from the node TYPE \"qed\"), that should be used. If not, the node should at minimum use \"deduction\" or equivalent, reflecting that it derives the conclusion from the assembled components.\n\nThis misclassification as \"assumption\" means the node could theoretically be \"accepted\" as a bare hypothesis, bypassing all upstream verification — which would defeat the purpose of the adversarial proof framework.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
