Its content is a work-in-progress diagnostic that: (a) identifies the F_O collapse problem from node 1.1, (b) proposes a vague possible fix ('possibly F_O should be defined differently'), and (c) lists test cases that should be checked but are NOT checked. A 'claim' node must contain a precise mathematical assertion. This node instead contains imperatives ('Verify...', 'Re-examine...', 'Resolve this definitional tension...') which are instructions for the prover, not provable claims. The node should be refactored into children that each state and prove a precise test-case result: (1.9.1) For O = complete transfer system, F_O = Sub(G) and the O-slice filtration equals the HHR regular slice filtration. (1.9.2) For O = trivial transfer system under a corrected F_O definition, compute F_O explicitly. (1.9.3) For G = C_p with the complete transfer system, verify the O-Slice Connectivity Theorem explicitly. (1.9.4) For G = C_p with the trivial transfer system, verify explicitly. As written, the node asks the right questions but answers none of them.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
