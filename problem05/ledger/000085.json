The proof is not assembled — it is broken at every level. A comprehensive tally:\n\nNODE 1.1 (F_O definition): 4 challenges, including:\n  - CRITICAL: F_O collapses to Sub(G) for ALL transfer systems O (ch-88eb381843e786c4). The definition is vacuous.\n  - Transfers vs norms conflation (ch-87e8d89311f41b2a).\n  - Missing proof of well-definedness (ch-37ac41ae6b92b2f7).\n\nNODE 1.2 (O-slice cells): 3 challenges, including:\n  - CRITICAL: Only regular slice cells defined, not general HHR cells (ch-a3b2aa31ce35f322).\n  - Missing dependency on 1.1 (ch-d2c553c9794ef8b7).\n\nNODE 1.3 (O-slice filtration): 6 challenges, including:\n  - CRITICAL: Localizing vs colocalizing confusion (ch-237dced2819bfe56).\n  - CRITICAL: Hausdorff property is FALSE for incomplete transfer systems (ch-913b2e8c6725f6f6).\n  - No proof content whatsoever (ch-f76a2341381096bc).\n\nNODE 1.4 (Functoriality): 4 challenges, including:\n  - CRITICAL: Boundary cases are false due to F_O collapse (ch-f5564c977e024f6e).\n  - Monotonicity claim is vacuous (ch-8a860a65975887d9).\n\nNODE 1.5 (Geometric FP computation): 4 challenges, including:\n  - CRITICAL: Main formula Phi^H(G+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K}) = S^m is WRONG (ch-1bed8381882c4894).\n\nNODE 1.6 (Theorem statement): 4 challenges, including:\n  - Off-by-one connectivity convention error (ch-3136558683a060b7).\n  - O-independence due to F_O collapse (ch-65f8a474237e6b3a).\n\nNODE 1.7 (Forward direction): 6 challenges, including:\n  - CRITICAL: RO(H)-to-integer transition unjustified (ch-30543161762ccef9).\n  - CRITICAL: Induction direction wrong (ch-7b129f308a997648).\n  - No proof content (ch-e0b31aea1bdc0fbc).\n\nNODE 1.8 (Reverse direction): 5 challenges, including:\n  - CRITICAL: RO(H)-to-integer passage unjustified (ch-b812134eb4b569e3).\n  - No proof content (ch-bf3074e5cd91ca15).\n\nNODE 1.9 (Test cases): Currently claimed by verifier-9, contains self-identified definitional tension.\n\nTOTAL: 36+ open challenges across 9 upstream nodes, with at least 10 critical-severity challenges. The proof tree is fundamentally broken at the definitional level (F_O collapses), at the computational level (geometric FP formula wrong), at the structural level (localizing vs colocalizing), and at the proof content level (most nodes contain no actual proof, only sketches).\n\nA QED node cannot be accepted when zero of its dependencies have been validated and all of them have unresolved critical challenges. The QED must remain blocked until ALL upstream challenges are resolved.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
