However, node 1.6 has an unresolved internal contradiction (challenge ch-3136558683a060b7): it states both 'floor(n/|H|)-connected' AND 'pi_k(Phi^H(X)) = 0 for k \u003c floor(n/|H|)' which differ by one under the standard connectivity convention.\n\nIn standard equivariant homotopy theory (following HHR), k-connected means pi_j = 0 for j \u003c= k. So floor(n/|H|)-connected means pi_j = 0 for j \u003c= floor(n/|H|). But 'pi_k = 0 for k \u003c floor(n/|H|)' means pi_j = 0 for j \u003c= floor(n/|H|) - 1, which is (floor(n/|H|)-1)-connected.\n\nHHR Theorem 4.42 states the bound as pi_k(Phi^H(X)) = 0 for k \u003c floor(n/|H|), i.e., (floor(n/|H|)-1)-connected. Node 1.8 adopts the verbal 'floor(n/|H|)-connected' from node 1.6, which is ONE MORE than HHR.\n\nThe base case analysis reveals the impact: for H = e, the node claims pi_k(X) = 0 for k \u003c n (since floor(n/1) = n). Under (n-1)-connectivity (HHR convention), this is correct: pi_k = 0 for k \u003c= n-1 is indeed (n-1)-connected, and pi_k = 0 for k \u003c n is the same thing. But for general H, the off-by-one matters when floor(n/|H|) is used in the inductive step. The node must adopt a consistent, explicit connectivity convention and verify all bounds match.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
