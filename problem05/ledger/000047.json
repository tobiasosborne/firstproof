Node 1.3 depends on the O-slice cells SC_O(n) from node 1.2, which depends on the family F_O from node 1.1. Therefore node 1.4 logically depends on all three predecessor nodes: 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.\n\nYet node 1.4 declares NO dependencies. This is a structural error because:\n\n1. If node 1.1's definition of F_O is modified (which is necessary given the critical definitional collapse), the meaning of tau_O^{\u003e=n} changes, and all claims in node 1.4 must be re-evaluated.\n\n2. If node 1.2's cell definition is corrected (currently defines only regular cells, not full HHR cells), the filtration changes, and boundary case claims change.\n\n3. If node 1.3's construction fails or is modified, the very object tau_O^{\u003e=n} that node 1.4 makes claims about may not exist or may have different properties.\n\nWithout declared dependencies, there is no mechanism to propagate taint from upstream errors to this node.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
