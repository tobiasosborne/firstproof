For the induction to work, the inductive statement must be precisely:\n\nP(k) := For all H in F_O with |H| = k, [G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H}, X]^G = 0 for all m with m*k \u003c n.\n\nThe inductive step must show: assuming P(j) for all j \u003c k, prove P(k).\n\nBut the node conflates TWO different things:\n(A) Vanishing of [G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H}, X]^G (what we need to show), and\n(B) Connectivity of Phi^H(X) (what we are given as hypothesis).\n\nThe induction is on the CONCLUSION (A), but uses the HYPOTHESIS (B). The node never clarifies how the inductive hypothesis P(j) for j \u003c k interacts with the given hypothesis that Phi^K(X) is floor(n/|K|)-connected for K in F_O with |K| \u003c |H|.\n\nSpecifically, at the inductive step for H with |H| = k:\n- We KNOW (by global hypothesis): Phi^H(X) is floor(n/k)-connected.\n- We KNOW (by inductive hypothesis): [G_+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K}, X]^G = 0 for all K in F_O with |K| \u003c k and m*|K| \u003c n.\n- We NEED TO SHOW: [G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H}, X]^G = 0 for m*k \u003c n.\n\nThe node does not explain how combining these two pieces of information yields the conclusion. The isotropy separation sequence connects pi_{m*rho_H}^H(X) to (i) the contribution from proper subgroups (via EF_+) and (ii) the geometric fixed point contribution (via tilde{EF}). But HOW the inductive hypothesis feeds into (i) and the global hypothesis feeds into (ii), and why the resulting connectivity bounds are sufficient, is entirely missing.\n\nFurthermore, the induction variable needs careful specification: does |H| range over ALL possible subgroup orders in F_O? Are conjugate subgroups handled simultaneously? The node gives no indication.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
