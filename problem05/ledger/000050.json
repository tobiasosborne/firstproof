The inference type is 'assumption' and there are no children nodes containing proof steps.\n\nEach of these claims requires non-trivial arguments:\n(a) Requires checking closure under colimits/limits and extensions, with the specific closure properties depending on whether this is a localizing or colocalizing subcategory (see other challenge).\n(b) Requires invoking the Bousfield localization existence theorem, which has specific hypotheses: the ambient category must be presentable (or well-generated triangulated), and the acyclics must be generated by a SET of objects. The latter requires verification that the O-slice cells of dimension \u003c n form a set (not a proper class), which is true but must be stated.\n(c) Exhaustiveness and Hausdorff-ness are independent properties requiring separate arguments (see other challenges for why both are problematic).\n\nThe node should be refined into children that contain actual proof steps, not left as an unproved assumption.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
