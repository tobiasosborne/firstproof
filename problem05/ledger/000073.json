The node says 'Prove the forward direction...' and 'show that the vanishing... implies...' but provides NO actual proof. It is a leaf node (no children) with inference type 'assumption' and contains only a high-level proof sketch: (a) apply Wirthmuller, (b) use isotropy separation, (c) induct on |H| descending. Each of these steps is non-trivial and requires substantial argument. The HHR proof of the analogous result (forward direction of Theorem 4.42 / Proposition 4.43) occupies several pages and involves careful analysis of the cofiber sequences relating RO(G)-graded homotopy groups to integer-graded geometric fixed point homotopy groups. The node should either: (1) Be refined into children that execute the proof steps (at minimum: a child for the base case H = G, a child for the inductive step using the isotropy separation sequence, a child establishing the key lemma that pi_{m*rho_H}^H vanishing implies integer-graded vanishing for Phi^H), or (2) Contain a substantially more detailed argument in its statement text. As written, the node is an unsubstantiated claim, not a proof.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
