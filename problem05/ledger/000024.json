(a) Complete transfer system: F_O = Sub(G), recover HHR Theorem 4.42. (b) Trivial transfer system: F_O = {G} union all subgroups of G (since family generated by {G} is all of Sub(G) -- WAIT: if only tr_G^G is in O then Sub_O^tr = {G}, and F_O = family generated by {G} = {subgroups of G} = Sub(G). Re-examine: the trivial transfer system should give the coarsest filtration. This suggests the correct definition may need refinement -- possibly F_O should be defined differently, using only those H where norm N_H^G is in O, not just transfer. Resolve this definitional tension. (c) G = C_p: verify explicitly for both transfer systems.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"844ee08f1801950fa20acca4c7571eff6460d9751465be1db2ddb7b123cbd7e1","created":"2026-02-10T19:23:25.338637853Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
