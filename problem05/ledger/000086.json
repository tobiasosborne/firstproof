This means:\n- Taint from the 4 open challenges on node 1.1 (including the critical F_O collapse) does not propagate here.\n- Taint from the 3 open challenges on node 1.2 does not propagate.\n- Taint from the 4 open challenges on node 1.6 does not propagate.\n\nIn reality, node 1.9 is ENTIRELY downstream of nodes 1.1-1.3 and 1.6. It cannot be meaningfully evaluated until those nodes are stabilized. The F_O collapse identified in node 1.1 (ch-88eb381843e786c4) is exactly the issue this node stumbles into in case (b). The missing dependency structure prevents the proof tree from correctly tracking this critical information flow.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
