The node claims that vanishing of pi_{m*rho_H}^H(X) for m \u003c n/|H| implies vanishing of pi_k(Phi^H(X)) for k \u003c floor(n/|H|). This is the central mathematical content of the forward direction, yet the node provides NO argument for this step. The groups pi_{m*rho_H}^H(X) = [S^{m*rho_H}, X]^H involve the REPRESENTATION sphere S^{m*rho_H}, which is NOT the same as the integer sphere S^m (with trivial H-action). Even though dim((rho_H)^H) = 1 so the H-fixed-point dimension of m*rho_H is m, the equivariant homotopy group pi_{m*rho_H}^H does not equal pi_m^H. The non-trivial representations in rho_H contribute non-trivially to the structure of [S^{m*rho_H}, X]^H. To go from vanishing at RO(H)-graded spots {m*rho_H} to integer-graded vanishing requires either: (1) An inductive argument using the isotropy separation sequence to peel off non-trivial representation summands from m*rho_H one at a time, reducing to lower-order subgroups (this is essentially the HHR argument, and it is substantial), or (2) A direct argument using the cofiber sequences coming from decomposing rho_H = 1 + rho_H^{free} and induction. Neither argument is provided. The node merely waves at the isotropy separation cofiber sequence and induction without executing any step. This gap is critical because it IS the entire content of the forward direction proof.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
