The node contains only the definition of Sub_O^tr(G) and the declaration that F_O is the family generated by it. There is no actual argument establishing:\n\n1. That the collection of all families containing Sub_O^tr(G) is nonempty (it is -- Sub(G) is such a family -- but this should be stated).\n2. That the intersection of families is a family (this is the standard argument but must be given).\n3. That F_O as constructed satisfies the family axioms (closure under conjugation and taking subgroups).\n\nWhile these are essentially immediate from the definition of 'family generated by a set,' the node claims to prove something without providing any proof content. Either:\n(a) The node should be refined into children that contain the actual proof steps, or\n(b) The node should be marked as a definition rather than a claim requiring proof.\n\nGiven that the definition itself has the critical collapsing issue (see other challenge), this proof gap is secondary but still a legitimate gap.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
