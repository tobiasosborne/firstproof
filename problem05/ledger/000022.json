Assume X is O-slice \u003e= n. Fix H in F_O. By hypothesis, [G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H}, X]^G = 0 for all m with m|H| \u003c n. By the Wirthmuller isomorphism, this equals pi_{m*rho_H}^H(X) = 0 for m \u003c n/|H|. Using the isotropy separation cofiber sequence and induction on |H| (descending), show that the vanishing of these RO(H)-graded homotopy groups implies pi_k(Phi^H(X)) = 0 for k \u003c floor(n/|H|).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"1492a1095af948575890b3153c25fd6503d1b0dc32c02242af820448e8ebbf51","created":"2026-02-10T19:23:25.338629898Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
