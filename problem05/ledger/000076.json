Two issues with the opening step: (1) The claimed identity [G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H}, X]^G = pi_{m*rho_H}^H(X) does NOT use the Wirthmuller isomorphism. It uses the INDUCTION-RESTRICTION ADJUNCTION: for any H-spectrum Y and G-spectrum X, [G_+ smash_H Y, X]^G = [Y, Res_H^G X]^H. This is the defining adjunction of induction, available in complete generality. The Wirthmuller isomorphism is the separate statement that G_+ smash_H Y = F_H(G_+, Y) (induction equals coinduction) for finite-index subgroups. While not mathematically wrong (the Wirthmuller isomorphism implies the adjunction), citing Wirthmuller when only the induction-restriction adjunction is needed is misleading and may cause confusion about what hypotheses are actually used. (2) The node states the hypothesis as '[G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H}, X]^G = 0 for all m with m|H| \u003c n.' But the definition of O-slice \u003e= n (from node 1.3) requires [Sigma, X]^G = 0 for ALL O-slice cells Sigma of dimension \u003c n. The O-slice cells of dimension \u003c n include G_+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K} for ALL K in F_O with m|K| \u003c n, not just for a FIXED H. The node fixes H and only uses the cells involving that specific H. This is fine for the forward direction (you only need vanishing against the H-cells to conclude about Phi^H), but the node should make explicit that it is using only a SUBSET of the O-slice \u003e= n hypothesis -- specifically, the vanishing against cells induced from H.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
