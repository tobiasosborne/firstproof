This asymmetry requires careful justification that is not provided.\n\nFor the FORWARD direction (1.7), descending induction makes sense: to compute Phi^G(X) one needs to 'peel off' contributions from G first, then work down to smaller subgroups. The isotropy separation sequence for G with respect to proper subgroups involves terms from subgroups K \u003c G, and descending induction handles K after G.\n\nFor the REVERSE direction (1.8), the claim is that ascending induction works: start with e (trivial subgroup), then work up. The stated reasoning is: 'the tom Dieck splitting introduces subgroups K \u003c H; since F_O is a family, K is in F_O, so the inductive hypothesis applies.'\n\nBut there is a subtlety: the isotropy separation for H uses the family of PROPER subgroups of H. The long exact sequence involves:\n- pi_{m*rho_H}^H(EF_+ smash X): this involves K \u003c H, which by ascending induction we have already handled.\n- pi_{m*rho_H}^H(tilde{EF} smash X): this involves the geometric fixed points Phi^H(X).\n\nFor ascending induction to work, we need: after handling all K \u003c H, the information about pi_*(Phi^K(X)) for K \u003c H (given by hypothesis) PLUS the inductive conclusion for K (i.e., pi_{m*rho_K}^K(X) = 0 in the right range) is sufficient to deduce pi_{m*rho_H}^H(EF_+ smash X) = 0. Combined with pi_*(Phi^H(X)) = 0 in the right range (by hypothesis), this would give pi_{m*rho_H}^H(X) = 0.\n\nHowever, the passage from 'pi_{m*rho_K}^K(X) = 0 for K \u003c H in the range m|K| \u003c n' to 'pi_{m*rho_H}^H(EF_+ smash X) = 0 in the range m|H| \u003c n' requires understanding how the EF_+ piece decomposes in terms of proper subgroups, which involves the TOM DIECK splitting (for general spectra, a filtration) and a non-trivial connectivity estimate. The connectivity arithmetic must be checked: does floor(n/|K|)-connectivity for K \u003c H actually imply the right vanishing range for pi_{m*rho_H}^H(EF_+ smash X)?\n\nThe node asserts this works but the arithmetic is not verified. In particular, the relation between the RO(H)-grading m*rho_H and the integer-grading via restriction to K \u003c H involves the dimension of (rho_H)|_K^K, which is [H:K], not 1. This dimensional factor is nowhere discussed in the node.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
