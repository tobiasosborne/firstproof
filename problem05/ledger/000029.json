But every transfer system O is a WIDE subcategory of the Burnside category, which means all identity morphisms are in O. In particular, tr_G^G (the identity transfer on G) is always in O. Therefore G is always in Sub_O^tr(G).\n\nNow, a 'family of subgroups' must be closed under conjugation AND taking subgroups. The family generated by the set {G} is necessarily ALL of Sub(G), because every subgroup H \u003c= G is a subgroup of G, so closure under taking subgroups forces H into F_O.\n\nConsequently, F_O = Sub(G) for EVERY transfer system O, regardless of how incomplete O is. The definition fails to capture any information about O at all.\n\nCONCRETE EXAMPLE: Let G = C_2 x C_2 (Klein four-group). Consider the minimal transfer system O_min where only the identity transfers tr_H^H are in O (no proper transfers). Then Sub_{O_min}^tr(G) = {G} (only tr_G^G exists to G), so F_{O_min} = family generated by {G} = Sub(G). This equals F_{O_max} for the COMPLETE transfer system. The definition is trivially the same in both extremes.\n\nThe prover noticed this in node 1.9 themselves. The correct definition should NOT use 'family generated by Sub_O^tr(G)' but rather should define F_O directly from which proper norms/transfers are available, e.g., F_O = {H \u003c= G : N_H^K is in O for all H \u003c= K \u003c= G} or Sub_O^tr(G) = {H \u003c G : tr_H^G is in O} (PROPER subgroups only), with the family generated by that set plus {e}.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
