Equivalently, the union (colimit) of the tau_O^{\u003e=n} over all n -\u003e -infinity is all of Sp^G.\n\nExhaustiveness means: for every X and every O-slice cell Sigma of sufficiently large dimension, [Sigma, X]^G = 0. For the standard HHR filtration, this holds because the slice cells G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H} of dimension m|H| have m -\u003e infinity as the dimension grows, and for any X, the homotopy groups [G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H}, X]^G = pi_{m*rho_H}^H(X) eventually vanish for dimensional reasons when X is bounded below.\n\nHowever, the node provides NO proof of exhaustiveness. This requires knowing:\n(1) For which spectra X is exhaustiveness true? All of Sp^G, or only connective spectra? In HHR, exhaustiveness holds for all spectra, but this relies on a connectivity argument that uses the specific form of the cells.\n(2) The argument requires that m|H| -\u003e infinity forces the underlying dimension m to also go to infinity (which is true since |H| \u003e= 1), and then appeal to pi_k(X) = 0 for k \u003e\u003e 0 for bounded-above spectra. But in the stable category, spectra are not necessarily bounded above or below. One needs a more careful argument.\n(3) The node states the claim but provides no argument. Since it has no children and inference type is 'assumption,' there is no proof content at all.\n\nThe node should either be refined with children proving exhaustiveness, or the exhaustiveness claim should be precisely stated (with hypotheses) and justified.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
