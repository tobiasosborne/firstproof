Via the Blumberg-Hill correspondence, this is equivalent to specifying an N_infinity operad, which determines which NORM maps N_H^K are available.\n\nThe critical question for the slice filtration is: what determines which slice cells G_+ smash_H S^{n rho_H} should be included? In the HHR slice filtration, ALL such cells appear because the complete transfer system allows all norms. For an incomplete transfer system, the intended restriction should be to those H for which the relevant norm structure is present.\n\nThe node writes Sub_O^tr(G) = {H \u003c= G : tr_H^G is in O}, using notation for ADDITIVE transfers. But:\n\n1. The condition 'tr_H^G is in O' only records whether there is a transfer from H to G specifically. For the slice filtration, what matters is the full norm structure: whether N_H^K is available for various intermediate K. A subgroup H might have tr_H^G in O but not have all intermediate norms needed for the slice cell arguments.\n\n2. The notation 'tr_H^G' suggests the additive transfer in the Burnside category. While Blumberg-Hill's transfer systems do encode this data, the node should be precise about whether it means:\n   (a) the pair (H,G) is in the transfer system O (i.e., there is a morphism G/H -\u003e G/G in O), or\n   (b) the actual additive transfer map in equivariant homotopy groups.\n   These are related but distinct concepts and the node conflates them.\n\n3. More fundamentally: the correct set to extract from O for the slice filtration should capture which H have the full norm structure needed for the slice cell G_+ smash_H S^{n rho_H} to be 'O-relevant.' This requires N_H^G (the multiplicative norm) to be in O, not just the additive transfer. While these are equivalent data in the Blumberg-Hill correspondence for a single pair (H,G), the node's imprecise language obscures this point and may lead to errors in later nodes.\n\nThe node must precisely define what 'tr_H^G is in O' means in terms of the transfer system as a subcategory of the Burnside category or orbit category, and clarify why this is the correct condition for the slice filtration.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
