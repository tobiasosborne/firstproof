The node states a monotonicity claim but contains no argument. The inference type is 'assumption' with no children providing a proof. The intended argument would be:\n  - O subset O' implies Sub_O^tr(G) subset Sub_{O'}^tr(G)\n  - implies F_O subset F_{O'}\n  - implies SC_O(n) subset SC_{O'}(n)\n  - implies tau_O^{\u003e=n} superset tau_{O'}^{\u003e=n} (fewer cells to be orthogonal to = more objects pass)\nBut none of these steps are present in the node.\n\n(B) THE ARGUMENT IS VACUOUS GIVEN THE F_O COLLAPSE. Since F_O = Sub(G) for all transfer systems O (as shown in the challenge on node 1.1), the chain above becomes:\n  - Sub(G) subset Sub(G)\n  - Sub(G) subset Sub(G)\n  - SC_O(n) = SC_{O'}(n) for all O, O'\n  - tau_O^{\u003e=n} = tau_{O'}^{\u003e=n} for all O, O'\nThe monotonicity is technically true but vacuously so: the map O -\u003e tau_O^{\u003e=*} is CONSTANT, sending every transfer system to the same filtration. This is mathematically correct but makes the entire claim trivial and useless. The node should not claim this as a substantive result when it follows from a broken definition.\n\n(C) MISSING DEPENDENCY. This node should depend on nodes 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, since it uses the definitions of F_O, SC_O(n), and tau_O^{\u003e=n} from those nodes. No dependencies are declared.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
