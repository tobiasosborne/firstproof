This means the set of achievable dimensions is {m*|H| : H in F_O, m \u003e= 0}, which for a general group G and family F_O will have GAPS. For example, if G = C_6 and F_O = {C_2, C_3, C_6}, then achievable dimensions are multiples of 2, 3, and 6 — so dimensions 1, 5, 7, 11, ... have no slice cells. This is consistent with a REGULAR slice filtration (where such gaps are expected and the filtration is periodic/sparse), but it is NOT consistent with the general HHR slice filtration (where every integer dimension has cells). The downstream node 1.3 defines tau_O^{\u003e=n} by testing against cells of dimension \u003c n. When there are dimension gaps, the filtration tau_O^{\u003e=n} = tau_O^{\u003e= n+1} for consecutive n with no cells in between, meaning many filtration stages collapse. This is not necessarily wrong but must be explicitly acknowledged, as it affects the structure of the O-slice spectral sequence and the statement of the connectivity theorem in node 1.6.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
