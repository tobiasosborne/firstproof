The STANDARD HHR slice cells (HHR Definition 4.2) include G_+ smash_H S^V for ALL H-representations V of a given dimension, not just V = m*rho_H. What is actually being defined here are the REGULAR slice cells (HHR Definition 4.23), which are a specific subset. This is a critical distinction because the regular slice filtration and the general slice filtration are DIFFERENT filtrations with different properties. The statement must either: (a) explicitly state this is the O-REGULAR slice filtration and use only cells G_+ smash_H S^{m*rho_H}, or (b) define the full O-slice cells as {G_+ smash_H S^V : H in F_O, dim(V) = n} for all H-representations V, which would give the general O-slice filtration. The downstream node 1.5 computes Phi^H(G_+ smash_K S^{m*rho_K}), which only makes sense for the regular variant. The statement is self-contradictory: it says 'standard HHR slice cells' but defines only the regular ones.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
