The O-slice cells are defined in node 1.2 (which itself depends on F_O from node 1.1). Yet node 1.3 declares NO dependencies.\n\nThis is a critical structural error for three reasons:\n\n(1) Node 1.1 has FOUR open challenges, including the critical finding that F_O collapses to Sub(G) for every transfer system O. If the definition of F_O is vacuous, then the O-slice cells in 1.2 are just the standard HHR slice cells, and the O-slice filtration in 1.3 is just the standard HHR slice filtration. The entire generalization is meaningless. Node 1.3 cannot be validated until the F_O definition is fixed.\n\n(2) Node 1.2 has THREE open challenges, including the finding that only REGULAR slice cells are defined (not general HHR slice cells). If the cell definition changes (e.g., to include all representations, not just multiples of rho_H), the filtration in 1.3 would change.\n\n(3) Without declared dependencies, taint propagation is broken. If nodes 1.1 or 1.2 are refuted, node 1.3 should automatically become tainted, but without the dependency links, this cannot happen.\n\nThe node must declare explicit dependencies on both 1.1 (for F_O) and 1.2 (for the O-slice cells).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
