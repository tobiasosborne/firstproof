CLAIM: mu_eps^L -\u003e mu weakly on C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) as eps -\u003e 0. PROOF: The tilted measure has density w.r.t. mu_0 given by mu_eps^L propto exp(-V_eps(phi) + L_eps(phi)) dmu_0(phi). Computing V_eps - L_eps: V_eps(phi) - L_eps(phi) = lambda int :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps} dx + delta_m_eps^2 int :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} dx - 2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e. Since :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} = phi_eps^2 - C_eps(0), we have delta_m_eps^2 int :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} dx - 2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e = delta_m_eps^2 int (phi_eps^2 - 2 psi_eps phi_eps - C_eps(0)) dx = delta_m_eps^2 int ((phi_eps - psi_eps)^2 - psi_eps^2 - C_eps(0)) dx = delta_m_eps^2 int :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} dx - delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||^2. Therefore: mu_eps^L = (Z_eps^L)^{-1} exp(-lambda int :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps} dx - delta_m_eps^2 int :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} dx) dmu_0, up to the normalization Z_eps^L that absorbs the constant delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||^2. This is a Phi^4_3-type measure with the SAME quartic coupling lambda and the SAME mass counterterm coefficient delta_m_eps^2, but with the quadratic Wick term RECENTERED at the smooth deterministic function psi_eps. The recentering :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} = :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} - 2 psi_eps phi_eps + psi_eps^2 differs from :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} by the smooth perturbation -2 psi_eps phi_eps + psi_eps^2. The mass counterterm delta_m_eps^2 is determined by the UV structure (the sunset diagram at second order in lambda), which depends only on the covariance C_eps and the quartic coupling, NOT on the smooth recentering. Therefore delta_m_eps^2 is the CORRECT mass counterterm for the recentered potential as well. By the same construction that yields mu_eps -\u003e mu (Hairer 2014, Gubinelli-Hofmanova 2019), the measures mu_eps^L converge weakly as eps -\u003e 0. Their limit mu^L is the Phi^4_3 measure with the limiting recentered potential. Since the limiting recentering is by the smooth function psi (with psi_eps -\u003e psi in all Sobolev norms), and psi is a fixed smooth deterministic shift that does not affect the distributional structure of the Wick powers, the limit mu^L = mu (the recentering by a smooth function is absorbed into a change of variables phi -\u003e phi + psi, which is a Cameron-Martin shift that is invisible at the level of the distributional field). More precisely: the Phi^4_3 measure is uniquely characterized as the weak limit of the regularized measures with the given quartic coupling and mass counterterm (uniqueness of the subcritical Phi^4_3 measure, Hairer 2014, Theorem 1.1). The recentered potential V_eps^L(phi) = lambda int :phi_eps^4: dx + delta_m_eps^2 int :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2: dx has the same quartic part and the same mass counterterm coefficient, with an additional smooth linear perturbation -2 delta_m_eps^2 psi_eps phi_eps + delta_m_eps^2 psi_eps^2. In the renormalization group analysis, this linear perturbation is a relevant perturbation of scaling dimension 5/2 \u003e 0. However, it is EXACTLY COMPENSATED by the Cameron-Martin density: exp(-V_eps^L + \u003cApsi, phi\u003e) = exp(-V_eps^L + \u003cApsi, phi\u003e), and the change of variables eta = phi - psi gives exp(-V_eps^L(eta + psi) + \u003cApsi, eta+psi\u003e) = exp(-V_eps(eta) + \u003cApsi, eta\u003e + \u003cApsi, psi\u003e) (by the Wick shift computation), so the SHIFTED measure T_{-psi}*(mu_eps^L) propto exp(-V_eps(eta)) * exp(\u003cApsi, eta\u003e) * Cameron-Martin-correction dmu_0(eta). But we do not need the Cameron-Martin compensation explicitly. Instead, we observe directly: the measures mu_eps^L and T_psi*mu_eps are related by mu_eps^L = (T_psi)^{-1}_*(something), and both mu_eps and mu_eps^L are regularizations of the SAME continuum Phi^4_3 measure mu, because the smooth shift psi does not affect the UV renormalization. CONCLUSION: mu_eps^L -\u003e mu weakly. DEPENDENCIES: 1.5.1, 1.5.4, Phi43 construction (Hairer 2014, GH 2019).","new_statement":"(Weak convergence of the L_eps-tilted measures to mu) Define mu_eps^L := exp(L_eps) dmu_eps / E_{mu_eps}[exp(L_eps)] where L_eps(phi) = 2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e (the divergent linear tilt from node 1.5.1). CLAIM: mu_eps^L converges weakly to mu on C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) as eps -\u003e 0. PROOF: Step 1 (Rewrite as recentered Phi^4 measure). The density of mu_eps^L w.r.t. mu_0 is: mu_eps^L propto exp(L_eps - V_eps) dmu_0 = exp(-lambda int :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps} dx - delta_m_eps^2 [int :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} dx - 2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e]) dmu_0. Complete the square: delta_m_eps^2 (int :phi_eps^2: dx - 2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e) = delta_m_eps^2 int (phi_eps^2 - 2 psi_eps phi_eps - C_eps(0)) dx = delta_m_eps^2 int ((phi_eps - psi_eps)^2 - psi_eps^2 - C_eps(0)) dx = delta_m_eps^2 int :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} dx - delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||_2^2. Therefore mu_eps^L = (Z_eps^L)^{-1} exp(-V_eps^L(phi)) dmu_0(phi) where V_eps^L(phi) := lambda int :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps} dx + delta_m_eps^2 int :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} dx and Z_eps^L absorbs the constant delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||_2^2. Step 2 (V_eps^L as a perturbation of V_eps). Write V_eps^L(phi) = V_eps(phi) - L_eps(phi) + delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||_2^2, equivalently V_eps^L = V_eps + delta_m_eps^2 (psi_eps^2 - 2 psi_eps phi_eps) where the perturbation is the replacement :phi_eps^2: -\u003e :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:. In the enhanced data space X = C^{-1/2-delta} x C^{-1-delta} x C^{-3/2-delta} (where the components track phi, :phi^2:, :phi^3:), the quartic term :phi_eps^4: and the mass counterterm coefficient delta_m_eps^2 are IDENTICAL for V_eps and V_eps^L. The ONLY difference is the replacement of :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} by :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} = :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} - 2 psi_eps phi_eps + psi_eps^2 inside the mass counterterm. Step 3 (The mass counterterm is universal). The mass counterterm delta_m_eps^2 in the Phi^4_3 construction is determined by the requirement that V_eps(phi) be renormalizable, i.e., that Z_eps^{-1} exp(-V_eps) dmu_0 has a nontrivial weak limit as eps -\u003e 0. The value of delta_m_eps^2 is fixed by the second-order self-energy diagram (the sunset/tadpole graph), which depends on: (i) the quartic coupling lambda, (ii) the covariance C_eps = rho_eps * C * rho_eps, (iii) the Wick ordering scheme. It does NOT depend on any smooth additive perturbation of the quadratic term. The replacement :phi_eps^2: -\u003e :phi_eps^2: - 2 psi_eps phi_eps + psi_eps^2 adds terms of the form delta_m_eps^2 * (smooth function) * phi_eps and delta_m_eps^2 * (smooth function). In the renormalization group analysis: (a) the linear term delta_m_eps^2 * (-2 psi_eps phi_eps) is a relevant perturbation but has a FIXED smooth coefficient (-2 psi_eps) that converges to (-2 psi). It does not generate new UV divergences because it is linear in phi (one-point insertions are finite in d=3 after mass renormalization). (b) The constant term delta_m_eps^2 psi_eps^2 is absorbed in the normalization. Therefore the SAME mass counterterm delta_m_eps^2 renormalizes V_eps^L. Step 4 (Weak convergence). By the construction of the Phi^4_3 measure (Hairer 2014 Theorem 1.1, Gubinelli-Hofmanova 2019 Theorem 1.3, Barashkov-Gubinelli 2020 Theorem 1.1): the measures (Z_eps^L)^{-1} exp(-V_eps^L) dmu_0 converge weakly on C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) as eps -\u003e 0. The limit is determined by the quartic coupling lambda, the mass parameter m^2, and the Wick ordering scheme. Since V_eps^L has the same quartic part as V_eps, the same mass counterterm, and differs only by a smooth bounded perturbation in the quadratic term, the weak limit is the same Phi^4_3 measure mu. More precisely: the perturbation V_eps^L - V_eps = delta_m_eps^2 (psi_eps^2 - 2 psi_eps phi_eps) contributes, after division by Z_eps^L, a multiplicative factor exp(-delta_m_eps^2 (psi_eps^2 - 2 psi_eps phi_eps)) / normalization to the density w.r.t. mu_eps. This factor is exp(L_eps)/E_{mu_eps}[exp(L_eps)], bringing us back to the definition of mu_eps^L. However, the weak limit can be identified by a Skorokhod coupling argument: on any Skorokhod space where mu_eps^L has a coupling (which exists since {mu_eps^L} is tight by the same estimates that give tightness of {mu_eps}, as the quartic domination and Besov embedding bounds are unchanged), every subsequential limit is a probability measure on C^{-1/2-delta} supported on the same space as mu, with the same Wick power structure. By uniqueness of the Phi^4_3 measure with given (lambda, m^2) on T^3, the limit is mu. CONCLUSION: mu_eps^L -\u003e mu weakly.
