The key estimates are: (a) Under mu, the smeared Wick powers integral psi :phi^3: dx and integral psi^2 :phi^2: dx are well-defined random variables (since psi and psi^2 are smooth test functions and :phi^3:, :phi^2: are bona fide distributions in C^{-3/2-delta}(T^3) and C^{-1-delta}(T^3) respectively). (b) Under mu, these random variables have finite exponential moments (sub-Gaussian concentration for the Phi^4_3 measure, Barashkov-Gubinelli). (c) The family {R_eps} is uniformly integrable w.r.t. the measures mu_eps, and mu_eps -\u003e mu weakly, so R_eps -\u003e R in L^1(mu). (d) E_mu[R] = 1, confirming R is a valid RN derivative.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"53c4d0d169b43dd98ab8f414645318732e82b2a11055590f665ae8c299e602b5","created":"2026-02-08T14:39:50.077901932Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
