Since this holds for all bounded continuous G, and C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) is a Polish space, we conclude T_psi*mu = rho as probability measures (portmanteau theorem / uniqueness of probability measures determined by C_b). In particular: (i) T_psi*mu \u003c\u003c mu (since rho \u003c\u003c mu by construction). (ii) d(T_psi*mu)/dmu = R := exp(Psi^{ren})/Z, with R \u003e 0 mu-a.s. (node 1.6.4.1(c)). (iii) E_mu[R] = 1 (node 1.6.4.1(b)). (iv) The identity extends from bounded continuous G to all bounded measurable G by the standard monotone class argument: the class of bounded measurable G satisfying E_{T_psi*mu}[G] = E_mu[G R] contains C_b, is closed under bounded pointwise limits, and hence contains all bounded Borel functions. CONCLUSION: T_psi*mu \u003c\u003c mu and d(T_psi*mu)/dmu(phi) = exp(Psi^{ren}(phi)) / Z.
