The node claims 'the BG Polchinski flow analysis applies to V_eps^{(alpha)} with modified but controlled lower-order couplings' and asserts the conclusion '-log Z_eps^{(alpha)} \u003e= -C' without providing the actual argument. Specifically: (1) The hypotheses of BG Proposition 4.1 are not verified for V_eps^{(alpha)}. The structural verification is done in sibling node 1.6.2.10.2.2.1, which is NOT declared as a dependency. (2) The node does not explain HOW the Polchinski flow bounds extend from V_eps to V_eps^{(alpha)}. The repaired sibling 1.6.2.10.2.2.1 provides the subordination inequality (SUB) showing that the perturbation preserves a positive fraction of the quartic coercivity, but this node does not reference or use that result. (3) The citation 'BG (2021, Section 2) for stability under potential perturbations' is vague — as noted in challenge ch-125b3c2e04a407f9 on node 1.6.2.10.2.2.1, neither BG (2021) Section 2 nor Barashkov's thesis states an explicit stability theorem of the form claimed. The gap is REPAIRABLE: the correct argument combines the Boue-Dupuis variational formula with the subordination inequality (SUB) from 1.6.2.10.2.2.1, showing that for any adapted drift u, the BG Polchinski flow bounds apply to V_eps^{(alpha)} because it has positive quartic coupling and controlled lower-order terms. But this argument must be STATED, not merely asserted.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
