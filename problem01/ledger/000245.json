(B) Lower bound Z_eps \u003e= 1 via Boue-Dupuis with trivial drift is valid: -log Z_eps \u003c= E_{mu_0}[V_eps] = 0 since E_{mu_0}[:phi_eps^j:_{C_eps}] = 0 for j \u003e= 1 by Wick ordering. Jensen's inequality (exp convex) gives the same result more simply. (C) Two-sided bound from BG 2020 Prop 4.3 is correctly cited. Reduction to sub-problems (i)+(ii) is sound. Minor: no formal dependencies declared but node uses definitions from 1.2 and external BG 2020."}
