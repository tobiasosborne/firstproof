{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-08T18:46:37.011829273Z","node_id":"1.3","note":"VERIFIED. All claims in node 1.3 are mathematically correct.\n\nSIGN VERIFICATION (critical check): The sign of the Cameron-Martin exponent is POSITIVE: d(T_psi* mu_0)/d(mu_0)(phi) = exp(+\u003c(-Delta+m^2)psi, phi\u003e - (1/2)||psi||^2_{H^1}). This is correct because T_psi* mu_0 integrates F(phi+psi) against mu_0, and CM-standard with h=+psi gives the positive linear term. The open challenge on node 1.2 claiming a sign error is itself incorrect.\n\nThe final formula R_eps = exp(-DeltaV_eps + \u003c(-Delta+m^2)psi, phi\u003e - (1/2)||psi||^2_{H^1}) with DeltaV_eps = V_eps(phi-psi) - V_eps(phi) has correct signs throughout.\n\nProof node 1.3.1 verified step-by-step: pushforward definition, mu_eps expansion via node 1.2, Cameron-Martin application with G(phi)=F(phi)exp(-V_eps(phi-psi)), assembly, RN derivative extraction, normalization E[R_eps]=1, and well-definedness all confirmed correct.\n\nMinor notes (non-blocking): inference type is \"assumption\" but should be a derived result; node 1.3 declares no dependencies but its proof depends on 1.2."}
