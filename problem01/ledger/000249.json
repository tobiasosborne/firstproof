The node claims V_eps^{(alpha)} satisfies the structural requirements of BG (2020) Polchinski flow analysis, but BG (2020) treats the Phi^4_3 theory with CONSTANT (translation-invariant) couplings on the torus T^3. The tilted potential V_eps^{(alpha)} has spatially varying coefficients:\n\n- For k=3: g_3(x) = -alpha f(x), which is x-dependent\n- For k=2: g_2(x) = delta_m_eps^2 - alpha f(x), which is x-dependent\n\nThe node states (P2) that these are 'smooth' but does NOT discuss whether the BG framework extends to potentials with spatially inhomogeneous lower-order couplings. This is a non-trivial extension:\n\n(1) The Polchinski equation is local in position space, which is favorable, but the flow equations for running couplings become FUNCTION-VALUED (g_j becomes a function g_j(x, t) of both position and RG scale), not just finitely many real-valued running couplings. BG's finite-dimensional ODE analysis of the coupling flow (their Section 4) does not immediately apply.\n\n(2) For k=2, the spatially varying mass perturbation -alpha f(x) means the mass renormalization condition involves a spatially inhomogeneous quantity. Since the one-loop mass counterterm delta_m_eps^2 is determined by a TRANSLATION-INVARIANT calculation (it cancels the divergence from C_eps(0) which is x-independent on the torus), the addition of a smooth bounded x-dependent mass perturbation plausibly does not affect the divergent part. But this argument must be made explicitly.\n\nThe gap is REPAIRABLE: since f is smooth on the compact torus, alpha f(x) is a bounded smooth function. The extension of the BG framework to bounded smooth perturbations of the couplings should follow from the fact that the Polchinski equation can be analyzed in Banach spaces of spatially dependent couplings. But the argument needs to be provided, not simply assumed.\n\nNote: The sibling node 1.6.2.10.2.3 partially addresses this in its Step 3.4, where the Polchinski flow argument is applied. But the structural claim here (node 1.6.2.10.2.2) is where this should be justified.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
