This convergence holds because: the smeared Wick powers converge (by the regularity theory for Wick powers on T^3) and the remaining terms are continuous linear functionals of phi. The limit Psi^{ren}(phi) is a well-defined random variable under mu.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"20d49428d4ed08e8d797e8da5d32187176fa20be64c99cd5d4f8434a94c7d460","created":"2026-02-08T14:40:41.436898504Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
