Node 1.6.2.10.2.3 declares NO dependencies, but its Step 3.4 relies on the structural verification that V_eps^{(alpha)} satisfies the hypotheses of the BG Polchinski flow analysis. This verification is performed in sibling node 1.6.2.10.2.2 (refuted, repaired as 1.6.2.10.2.2.1), which establishes: (P1) quartic positivity, (P4) cubic subordination via Young's inequality with the explicit estimate (SUB), and (P5) compatibility of spatial inhomogeneity with the BG framework. Without these structural inputs, Step 3.4's assertion that 'the BG Polchinski flow analysis applies to V_eps^{(alpha)}' is unjustified. The node should formally depend on 1.6.2.10.2.2.1.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
