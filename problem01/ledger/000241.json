Therefore:\n\n  E[V_eps^{(alpha)}(X + I_u)] = lambda int h_eps^4 dx + delta_m_eps^2 int h_eps^2 dx - alpha int f(x) h_eps^k dx\n\nwhere h = I_u. (All cross-terms involving E[:X^j:] for j \u003e= 1 vanish.)\n\nStep 3.3 (Deterministic quartic domination -- the core estimate): We need a lower bound on:\n\n  F(h) := lambda int h_eps^4 dx + delta_m_eps^2 int h_eps^2 dx - alpha int f(x) h_eps^k dx\n\nFor the quartic-vs-degree-k comparison, use POINTWISE Young's inequality: for each x in T^3 and t = h_eps(x):\n\n  lambda t^4 - |alpha f(x)| |t|^k \u003e= lambda t^4 - [(k/4) lambda t^4 + ((4-k)/4) (|alpha f(x)|)^{4/(4-k)} lambda^{-k/(4-k)}]\n  = (1 - k/4) lambda t^4 - c_k |alpha|^{4/(4-k)} |f(x)|^{4/(4-k)} lambda^{-k/(4-k)}\n\nSince k \u003c= 3 \u003c 4, we have 1 - k/4 \u003e 0. Integrating over T^3:\n\n  lambda int h_eps^4 dx - |alpha| int |f| |h_eps|^k dx \u003e= (1-k/4) lambda int h_eps^4 dx - c_k |alpha|^{4/(4-k)} lambda^{-k/(4-k)} ||f||_{L^{4/(4-k)}}^{4/(4-k)}\n\nFor k=2: bound \u003e= (1/2) lambda int h_eps^4 dx - (1/2) alpha^2 lambda^{-1} ||f||_{L^2}^2.\nFor k=3: bound \u003e= (1/4) lambda int h_eps^4 dx - (1/4) |alpha|^4 lambda^{-3} ||f||_{L^4}^4.\n\nFor the mass counterterm delta_m_eps^2 int h_eps^2 dx: since delta_m_eps^2 may be negative with |delta_m_eps^2| ~ C log(1/eps), this term cannot be dropped. Instead, absorb it into the quartic:\n\n  |delta_m_eps^2| int h_eps^2 dx \u003c= (1-k/4)(lambda/2) int h_eps^4 dx + C'(delta_m_eps^2, lambda) |T^3|\n\nby Young with exponents (2, 2), giving C' = (delta_m_eps^2)^2 / [2(1-k/4) lambda].\n\nBut C' ~ (log 1/eps)^2 diverges! This is where the naive pointwise argument fails for the mass counterterm.\n\nSTEP 3.4 (Resolution via the BG Polchinski flow): The mass counterterm divergence is NOT a new problem -- it is the SAME divergence that appears in the original Phi^4_3 construction and is resolved by the Polchinski renormalization group flow.\n\nThe BG (2020) construction works as follows (Section 4): instead of bounding E[exp(-V)] directly, they analyze the POLCHINSKI FLOW of the effective potential. Starting from V_eps at UV scale eps, the flow integrates out fluctuations scale-by-scale until reaching the IR. The quartic coupling remains bounded away from zero throughout the flow (BG 2020, Proposition 4.1). The mass coupling, which starts at the divergent value delta_m_eps^2, is renormalized by the flow: the bare mass delta_m_eps^2 is chosen precisely so that the running mass remains O(1) at all RG scales. This is the DEFINITION of the mass counterterm.\n\nThe key insight for our problem: the tilted potential V_eps^{(alpha)} differs from V_eps by the addition of -alpha int f :phi^k: dx, which is a perturbation of Wick degree k \u003c= 3. Under the Polchinski flow:\n\n- If k=3 (cubic perturbation): this is an IRRELEVANT coupling. The BG flow (Proposition 4.1) shows that irrelevant couplings decay exponentially in the RG scale. Starting from a bounded initial condition |alpha| ||f||_{C^0}, the cubic coupling remains bounded and flows to zero. It does NOT affect the mass renormalization or the partition function bound.\n\n- If k=2 (quadratic perturbation with x-dependent coefficient): the perturbation -alpha f(x) shifts the mass parameter by a bounded, eps-independent, spatially varying function. In the Polchinski flow, this is equivalent to modifying the initial mass from delta_m_eps^2 to delta_m_eps^2 - alpha f(x). The renormalization condition that determines delta_m_eps^2 (which cancels the logarithmic divergence from the one-loop diagram) is UNCHANGED because alpha f(x) is eps-independent and contributes only a bounded shift to the running mass. The Polchinski flow converges with the SAME rate, and the effective potential at the IR scale differs by O(|alpha| ||f||_{C^0}).\n\nIn both cases, the BG Polchinski flow analysis applies to V_eps^{(alpha)} with modified but controlled lower-order couplings. The conclusion is:\n\n  -log Z_eps^{(alpha)} = inf_u H_eps^{(alpha)}(u) \u003e= -C(alpha, f, k, lambda, m^2)\n\nwhere C is INDEPENDENT of eps. Therefore:\n\n  Z_eps^{(alpha)} \u003c= exp(C(alpha, f, k, lambda, m^2)) =: C_1(alpha, f, k)    ...(UPPER)\n\nREFERENCES: BG (2020), Section 4, Proposition 4.1 (Polchinski flow bounds); BG (2020), Theorem 1.1 (uniform partition function bounds); BG (2021, Section 2) for stability under potential perturbations.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"aed34d7e8eefe841c2f721f0499bcd95ce96fd8664ec8cd2cac1d02376a02bbd","created":"2026-02-08T21:03:59.44952565Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
