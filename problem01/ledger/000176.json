The second inequality treats int :phi_eps^2: dx and int :phi_eps^4: dx as if the pointwise relationship (:phi^2:)^2 \u003c= :phi^4: held, but in fact :phi_eps^4: = (:phi_eps^2:)^2 - 4 C_eps(0) :phi_eps^2: - 2 C_eps(0)^2, so Young's applied to :phi_eps^2: yields a remainder involving 4 C_eps(0) int :phi_eps^2: dx + 2 C_eps(0)^2 |T^3|, both eps-dependent and divergent. The clean Young's inequality ab \u003c= a^2/(4c) + cb^2 only applies to raw powers phi^2, phi^4, not to Wick-ordered quantities. The proof silently conflates Wick and raw powers in the Young's step.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
