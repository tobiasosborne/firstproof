This is not an assumption -- it requires verification/proof. The correct inference type would be something like 'lemma' or 'verification'. While this does not affect the mathematical content, it affects how the node should be evaluated: an assumption is taken as given, while a claim needs justification. The justification IS provided (properties P1-P4), so this is a labeling issue rather than a logical one.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
