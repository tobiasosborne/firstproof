This deterministic lower bound is FALSE.\n\nThe Wick-ordered potential V_eps = lambda int :phi_eps^4: dx + delta_m_eps^2 int :phi_eps^2: dx, when expanded into raw powers, has the form:\n\nV_eps = lambda int phi_eps^4 dx + (delta_m_eps^2 - 6 lambda C_eps(0)) int phi_eps^2 dx + (constant terms involving C_eps(0)^2)\n\nThe coefficient of int phi_eps^2 dx is (delta_m_eps^2 - 6 lambda C_eps(0)), where C_eps(0) ~ c/eps diverges much faster than delta_m_eps^2 ~ c' lambda^2 log(1/eps). The resulting lower bound (by completing the square) involves terms of order -C * C_eps(0)^2 ~ -C/eps^2, which DIVERGES as eps -\u003e 0.\n\nThe cited Gubinelli-Hofmanova Lemma 2.3 establishes that the partition function Z_eps = E_{mu_0}[exp(-V_eps)] is bounded above and below by eps-independent constants. This is a PROBABILISTIC bound on the integral, not a deterministic pointwise bound on V_eps.\n\nThe CONCLUSION E_{mu_0}[exp(-V_eps/2)] \u003c= C is still obtainable (by Cauchy-Schwarz: E[exp(-V/2)] \u003c= (E[exp(-V)])^{1/2} = Z_eps^{1/2} \u003c= C^{1/2}), so this gap is REPAIRABLE. But the stated justification is wrong.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
