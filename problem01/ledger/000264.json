The node states 'If k=3 (cubic perturbation): this is an IRRELEVANT coupling. The BG flow (Proposition 4.1) shows that irrelevant couplings decay exponentially in the RG scale.' This is FALSE. Standard power counting in d=3 gives the engineering dimension of the int phi^3 dx coupling as d - 3(d-2)/2 = 3 - 3/2 = 3/2 \u003e 0, which means the cubic interaction is RELEVANT (positive engineering dimension), not irrelevant. This error was already identified and corrected in sibling node 1.6.2.10.2.2 (challenge ch-6d636ff8e99979f5) and the repaired node 1.6.2.10.2.2.1 correctly replaces RG irrelevance with quartic subordination via Young's inequality. The present node 1.6.2.10.2.3 was not updated to reflect this correction and still contains the false claim. The correct justification for why the cubic term does not obstruct the analysis is QUARTIC SUBORDINATION (Young's inequality showing lambda t^4 dominates |alpha f(x)| |t|^3), not RG irrelevance.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
