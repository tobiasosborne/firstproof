This contradicts the validated Node 1.4.4 which establishes delta_m_eps^2 ~ lambda^2 log(1/eps). The logarithmic rate from Node 1.4.4 is the standard result for the second-order mass counterterm in Phi^4_3 (sunset diagram). The rate eps^{-1} would be a linear divergence, not logarithmic. This error does not affect the conclusion (all that matters for the classification is that delta_m_eps^2 diverges), but it is a factual misstatement.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
