This is because T_psi* mu_0(A) = mu_0(A-psi), so applying Cameron-Martin with shift h=-psi gives a minus sign. The error does NOT affect any conclusion since only strict positivity of the density is used downstream, and exp(anything finite) \u003e 0 regardless of sign.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
