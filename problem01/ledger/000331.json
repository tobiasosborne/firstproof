Two critical flaws found: (1) TIGHTNESS FAILURE: The family {mu_eps^L} is NOT tight in C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3). The exponential tilt L_eps = 2*delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e has diverging coefficient delta_m_eps^2 ~ log(1/eps). Under mu_eps^L, E[\u003cpsi, phi\u003e] diverges (at least as (log 1/eps)^{1/3} from quartic-vs-linear competition), which forces ||phi||_{C^{-1/2-delta}} -\u003e infinity in expectation, contradicting tightness. The claim that tightness follows from the same quartic domination as for {mu_eps} is false because the divergent tilt overwhelms quartic confinement. (2) WRONG LIMIT: Even if tightness held, the identification of the limit as mu is unjustified. Phi^4_3 uniqueness (Hairer, GH, BG) concerns independence from regularization, NOT invariance under divergent potential perturbations. V_eps^L differs from V_eps by a DIVERGENT quantity. In shifted variables chi=phi-psi, V_eps^L becomes a Phi^4_3 potential for chi with additional cubic/quadratic/linear terms (from expanding (chi+psi)^4) that CHANGE the limiting measure (breaking Z_2 symmetry). The limit of mu_eps^L cannot be mu.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"a3e205e0b5526589d909ff49893d826834bdedd578d9d1852253983625359dfd","created":"2026-02-09T08:22:38.59189597Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
