For k=1 (linear functional), this follows from sub-Gaussian tails of the Phi^4_3 measure (Barashkov-Gubinelli). For k=2,3, this follows from the Nelson hypercontractivity estimates adapted to the Phi^4_3 setting, using the fact that the quartic interaction provides stronger-than-Gaussian decay.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"cd43437cdaa680d34695695aafb6e42268cc83763efd56f5e01c7f5853794cf5","created":"2026-02-08T14:41:03.33189242Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
