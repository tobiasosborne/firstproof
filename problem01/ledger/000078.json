All three claims correct: (1) mu_eps ~ mu_0 via strictly positive density (nodes 1.2.1-1.2.4), (2) T_psi* mu_0 ~ mu_0 by Cameron-Martin (1.2.5), (3) T_psi* mu_eps ~ mu_eps by transitivity (1.2.6). Minor sign error in RN derivative formula of 1.2.5 noted in challenge ch-d037b236fd800479, immaterial to conclusions since only positivity is used."}
