Node states: 'the duality pairing between C^alpha and C^{-beta} is well-defined whenever alpha + beta \u003e 0'. Using the notation where alpha = 3/2+delta' \u003e 0 and beta = 3/2+delta \u003e 0, the correct condition is alpha \u003e beta (equivalently alpha - beta \u003e 0), NOT alpha + beta \u003e 0. The condition alpha + beta \u003e 0 is trivially true for any positive alpha, beta and proves nothing. In standard notation: for f in C^{s_1}, g in C^{s_2}, the pairing is well-defined when s_1 + s_2 \u003e 0, which translates to alpha - beta \u003e 0 (not alpha + beta \u003e 0) in the node's notation. The conclusion happens to be correct since delta' can be chosen \u003e delta, but the stated analytical condition is wrong.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
