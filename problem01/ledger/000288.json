Mathematical content is correct. Core argument is sound: Boue-Dupuis correctly applied; adapted drift subtlety properly handled; dependency on 1.6.2.10.2.2.1 correctly used; generalization from V_eps to V_eps^{(alpha)} justified by unchanged stochastic estimates, preserved quartic coercivity, and quartic subordination of perturbation."}
