Specifically: let X = C^{-1/2-delta} x C^{-1-delta} x C^{-3/2-delta} be the enhanced data space, equipped with any of the equivalent product Besov norms. The BG construction represents the enhanced data under mu as (phi, :phi^2:, :phi^3:) = Psi(X, u*) where X is the GFF (Gaussian), u* is the optimizer in the Boue-Dupuis formula, and Psi is the Wick power lifting. The resulting measure mu on X inherits concentration from the Gaussian structure. Concretely: for any L-Lipschitz functional F: X -\u003e R (with respect to the product Besov norm), mu satisfies P_mu(|F - M_F| \u003e t) \u003c= C exp(-c t^2/L^2) for all t \u003e 0, where M_F is a median (or mean) of F under mu and C, c \u003e 0 are universal constants depending only on the LSI/concentration constant of mu. This sub-Gaussian concentration follows from the log-Sobolev inequality for mu. The LSI for Phi^4_3 on T^3 is established by combining: (i) the Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020) variational representation, (ii) the Polchinski RG flow analysis which gives uniform spectral gap/LSI for the finite-dimensional approximations, and (iii) passage to the continuum limit. The LSI constant C_LS is finite and depends on (lambda, m^2, |T^3|) but not on any UV cutoff.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"dc1d6b9f14d30784dfbc2b8b2aebbc34ab0c6319f151a48a40c9f0db372de5e6","created":"2026-02-08T20:00:46.028790316Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
