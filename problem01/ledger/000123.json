The proof itself contradicts this: Part III demonstrates that for ANY fixed p \u003e 1 independent of eps, E_{mu_eps}[R_eps^p] diverges as eps -\u003e 0 (the exponential factor exp(sigma^2(p^2-1)beta_eps^2/2) grows as exp(C(log 1/eps)^2)). The proof then silently reinterprets 'bounded in L^p for suitable p' to mean either (a) L^p for each FIXED eps (which is trivial and not a useful bound), or (b) uniform integrability in L^1 (which is not proven). The node statement should be corrected to reflect what is actually established: for each fixed eps, R_eps is in L^p(mu_eps) for all p \u003e= 1, but the L^p norms are NOT uniformly bounded in eps for any fixed p \u003e 1. The statement as written is misleading and overpromises.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
