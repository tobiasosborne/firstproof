The node cites 'Theorem 1.1', 'Theorem 2.1', and 'Section 3' (a priori estimates), and states 'Section 4 concerns Gamma-convergence'. The actual BG (2020) [Duke Math. J. 169(17), 3339-3415] uses PLAIN numbering: (a) Main result is Theorem 1 (not 1.1), in Section 1. (b) Boue-Dupuis is Theorem 2 (not 2.1), in Section 2. (c) Section 3 is 'Two dimensions' (2D warmup), NOT 3D a priori estimates; stochastic estimates are in Section 8 (Propositions 2-11). (d) Section 4 is 'Three dimensions', NOT Gamma-convergence; Gamma-convergence is Section 6. The mathematical CONTENT attributed to these references is accurate, so this is a citation format error. But the claim in (R4) that citations are 'CORRECT' is itself incorrect.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
