This avoids the incorrect use of Fatou's lemma across different probability spaces (which was the error in Attempt 1).\n\nStep C.1 (Skorokhod representation): The regularized Phi^4_3 measures mu_eps converge weakly to mu on the enhanced data space X := C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) x C^{-1-delta}(T^3) x C^{-3/2-delta}(T^3) (this is established in the construction — Hairer 2014, Gubinelli-Hofmanova 2019). By the Skorokhod representation theorem (applicable because X is a Polish space), there exist:\n  - A probability space (Omega, F, P)\n  - Random variables Phi_eps = (phi_eps', :phi_eps'^2:, :phi_eps'^3:) with law mu_eps under P\n  - A random variable Phi = (phi', :phi'^2:, :phi'^3:) with law mu under P\n\nsuch that Phi_eps -\u003e Phi P-a.s. in the product topology of X. In particular:\n  :phi_eps'^k: -\u003e :phi'^k: in C^{-k/2-delta}(T^3) P-a.s. for k = 1, 2, 3.\n\nStep C.2 (Almost-sure convergence of the smeared quantities): Since f in C^inf(T^3) subset C^{k/2+2*delta}(T^3), the duality pairing is continuous:\n  \u003cf, :phi_eps'^k:\u003e -\u003e \u003cf, :phi'^k:\u003e P-a.s.\n\n(This uses the continuity of the pairing C^{k/2+2*delta} x C^{-k/2-delta} -\u003e R, combined with the a.s. convergence of :phi_eps'^k: in C^{-k/2-delta}.)\n\nTherefore: exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps'^k:\u003e) -\u003e exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi'^k:\u003e) P-a.s.\n\nStep C.3 (Uniform integrability): By node 1.6.2.10.2, for each alpha:\n  E_P[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps'^k:\u003e)] = E_{mu_eps}[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps^k:\u003e)] \u003c= M(alpha, f, k)\n\nuniformly in eps. Moreover, for alpha' \u003e alpha:\n  E_P[exp(alpha' \u003cf, :phi_eps'^k:\u003e)] \u003c= M(alpha', f, k) \u003c infinity\n\nThis means that the family {exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps'^k:\u003e)}_{eps \u003e 0} is UNIFORMLY INTEGRABLE on (Omega, P). (Uniform integrability follows from the existence of a uniform bound on E[|Y_eps|^{1+delta}] for some delta \u003e 0; here we can take Y_eps = exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps'^k:\u003e) and use the bound E[Y_eps^2] = E[exp(2*alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps'^k:\u003e)] \u003c= M(2*alpha, f, k) \u003c infinity, uniformly in eps.)\n\nStep C.4 (Dominated convergence / Vitali convergence): The combination of:\n  (i) exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps'^k:\u003e) -\u003e exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi'^k:\u003e) P-a.s. (Step C.2)\n  (ii) The family is uniformly integrable (Step C.3)\n\nimplies, by the Vitali convergence theorem:\n  E_P[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps'^k:\u003e)] -\u003e E_P[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi'^k:\u003e)]\n\nas eps -\u003e 0. Since Phi' has law mu under P:\n  E_P[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi'^k:\u003e)] = E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e)]\n\nTherefore:\n  E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e)] = lim_{eps -\u003e 0} E_{mu_eps}[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps^k:\u003e)] \u003c= M(alpha, f, k) \u003c infinity.\n\nThis establishes exponential integrability under the LIMITING measure mu, for all alpha in R and k in {2,3}.\n\nCRITICAL POINTS:\n(1) The Skorokhod coupling operates on a SINGLE probability space, so Fatou/Vitali are applied to a FIXED measure P on a FIXED space Omega. This avoids the error of Attempt 1 (Fatou across changing measures).\n(2) The Wick powers are treated as SINGLE distributional objects throughout (no decomposition into raw powers). The Skorokhod coupling works on the enhanced data space where Wick powers are components of the random element.\n(3) The a.s. convergence of the enhanced data on the Skorokhod space follows from the weak convergence of mu_eps to mu on X, which is part of the Phi^4_3 construction.\n(4) The uniform bound M(alpha, f, k) comes from node 1.6.2.10.2 (quartic domination at the regularized level), not from any property of the limiting measure alone.\n\nREFERENCES: Skorokhod representation theorem (Billingsley, Convergence of Probability Measures, Theorem 6.7); Vitali convergence theorem; node 1.6.2.10.2 (uniform exponential bounds); node 1.6.1 (Wick powers in Besov spaces).","inference":"modus_ponens","dependencies":["1.6.2.10.2","1.6.1"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"9905f18c3f9184fbabd3d2b5ac834e1a108a30cb6d330a641ef227d541790e3c","created":"2026-02-08T20:17:19.953168636Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
