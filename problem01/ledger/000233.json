All four steps verified: (C.1) X is Polish, Skorokhod gives joint a.s. convergence of the full enhanced data triple; (C.2) Besov duality has strict gap delta\u003e0, pairings converge a.s.; (C.3) UI from de la Vallee-Poussin at parameter 2alpha, correctly using the for-all-alpha hypothesis; (C.4) Vitali convergence correctly applied. Avoids all six HANDOFF pitfalls. However, the absolute conclusion is NOT established because input node 1.6.2.10.2 is REFUTED."}
