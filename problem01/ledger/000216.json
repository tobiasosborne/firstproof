Node 1.6.2.5, validated.\n\nFor k in {2,3}: E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e)] \u003c= M(alpha, f, k) \u003c infinity for all alpha in R.\n  Proof: Three-step argument:\n  (A) Uniform-in-eps L^p bounds for ||:phi_eps^k:||_{C^{-k/2-delta}} under mu_eps, from the Phi^4_3 construction (node 1.6.2.10).\n  (B) Uniform-in-eps exponential moment bounds E_{mu_eps}[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps^k:\u003e)] \u003c= M(alpha,f,k), via quartic domination using the a priori estimate ||:phi_eps^k:||_{C^{-k/2-delta}} \u003c= C(1 + V_eps)^{k/4} and Young's inequality with k \u003c= 3 \u003c 4 (node 1.6.2.10.2).\n  (C) Passage to the limit via Skorokhod representation on the enhanced data space X, giving a.s. convergence on a common probability space, followed by Vitali convergence using the uniform integrability from (B) (node 1.6.2.10.3).\n\nThis proof AVOIDS the three errors identified in previous attempts:\n  (i) No Wick-to-raw decomposition: Wick powers are treated as single distributional objects in Besov spaces throughout. The a priori estimate (AP) relates the Besov norm ||:phi_eps^k:||_{C^{-k/2-delta}} to V_eps without expanding Wick into raw powers.\n  (ii) No Fatou across different measures: The Skorokhod coupling provides random variables on a SINGLE probability space, and Vitali convergence is applied to a FIXED probability measure P.\n  (iii) No unsupported enhanced-data concentration: We do NOT claim sub-Gaussian concentration for Lipschitz functionals of the enhanced data. Instead, the exponential integrability is established at the regularized level via quartic domination and then transferred to the limit by coupling.\n\nThis establishes the claim of node 1.6.2 in full: for all smooth f, all k=1,2,3, and all alpha in R, E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e)] \u003c infinity.
