The full equation involves the two-point propagator dot{C}_t(x,y) at DISTINCT spatial points x,y and is fundamentally non-local. The formula given in P5a is valid only under the local potential approximation (where V_t = int v_t(phi(x),x) dx). In the nonlinear term, the product (delta V/delta phi(x))(delta V/delta phi(y)) weighted by dot{C}_t(x,y) couples different spatial points. However, the CONCLUSION that spatial inhomogeneity is compatible with the BG framework is CORRECT, because: (1) in the Boue-Dupuis variational framework, spatial dependence of couplings enters only through ordinary integrals over T^3 (P4/SUB); (2) mass renormalization is unaffected (P5c); (3) the BG upper bound via Boue-Dupuis does not require locality.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
