This pathwise bound is (1) NOT established by the cited references, and (2) implausible due to a fundamental norm-type mismatch.\n\n(1) MISATTRIBUTION: Mourrat-Weber (2017) Theorem 3.2 and Gubinelli-Hofmanova (2019) Proposition 4.3 are DYNAMICAL a priori estimates for the stochastic quantization equation. They bound the solution of the parabolic PDE in terms of the stochastic data and initial conditions, involving TIME integrals of the potential energy (not the potential at a single time). At equilibrium (for the invariant measure mu_eps), these estimates yield MOMENT bounds of the form E_{mu_eps}[||:phi_eps^k:||^p] \u003c= C(p), not pointwise bounds relating the Besov norm to V_eps for individual field configurations.\n\n(2) NORM-TYPE MISMATCH: The bound (AP) attempts to control the Besov C^{-k/2-delta} norm of :phi_eps^k: (which is a supremum over spatial locations and frequency scales of smoothed Wick powers) by V_eps(phi) = lambda int :phi_eps^4: dx + ... (which is a spatial INTEGRAL of Wick powers). A supremum norm cannot in general be controlled by an integral (L^1-type) quantity: a field configuration with a spatially localized spike can have a large Besov norm while having a moderate spatially integrated potential. There is no general inequality of this type, and no specific argument for the Phi^4_3 setting is provided.\n\nWithout (AP), the entire chain of reasoning in Method 3 (Steps B.4 through the COMBINING step) collapses. The Young's inequality domination argument (which is correct in its formal structure) has no input, because the key bound linking the perturbation \u003cf, :phi_eps^k:\u003e to the potential V_eps is missing.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
