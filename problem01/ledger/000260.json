(1) Arithmetic error in C_0 constant -- wrong numerical value but qualitative conclusion unaffected. (2) P5a locality claim incorrect but conclusion about spatial inhomogeneity holds via Boue-Dupuis. (3) P5d reference citations imprecise. The repair correctly addresses both original refutation issues: cubic subordination via Young replaces false RG-irrelevance claim, and spatial inhomogeneity is properly handled."}
