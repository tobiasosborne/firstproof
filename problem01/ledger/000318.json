The family {mu_eps^L} is tight on C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3). PROOF: mu_eps^L = (Z_eps^L)^{-1} exp(-V_eps^L) dmu_0 where V_eps^L = lambda int :phi_eps^4: dx + delta_m_eps^2 int :(phi_eps-psi_eps)^2: dx. Since :(phi_eps-psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} \u003e= -C_eps(0) (because (phi_eps-psi_eps)^2 \u003e= 0), we have V_eps^L \u003e= lambda int :phi_eps^4: dx - delta_m_eps^2 C_eps(0)|T^3|. The tightness of {mu_eps^L} on C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) follows from the same Besov embedding bounds used for {mu_eps}: the key a priori estimate E_{mu_eps^L}[||phi||_{C^{-1/2-delta}}^p] \u003c= C_p (uniformly in eps) depends only on the quartic coercivity of the potential and the Gaussian covariance structure (Mourrat-Weber 2017 Lemma 4.1, Gubinelli-Hofmanova 2019 Proposition 3.3). Since V_eps^L has the same quartic part as V_eps, these bounds carry over. Step B (Limit identification). By tightness, {mu_eps^L} has subsequential weak limits. Any such limit mu* is a probability measure on C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3). We show mu* = mu. The Phi^4_3 measure mu on T^3 with given coupling lambda and mass m^2 is the UNIQUE weak limit of the regularized measures Z_eps^{-1} exp(-V_eps) dmu_0 (Hairer 2014 Theorem 1.1, for the torus with fixed parameters). The measure mu_eps^L differs from mu_eps by the exponential tilt exp(L_eps)/E_{mu_eps}[exp(L_eps)] where L_eps = 2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e. This tilt replaces the mass counterterm :phi_eps^2: by :(phi_eps-psi_eps)^2: = :phi_eps^2: - 2 psi_eps phi_eps + psi_eps^2. The mass counterterm delta_m_eps^2 is a UNIVERSAL quantity determined by the second-order self-energy (sunset diagram): delta_m_eps^2 = c lambda^2 Tr(C_eps^2) + O(lambda^3), depending only on the quartic coupling and the propagator C_eps. This formula is UNCHANGED by the smooth recentering at psi_eps, because the recentering adds to the potential only terms linear in phi (which affect the tadpole but not the self-energy) and constants. Therefore the same counterterm delta_m_eps^2 renormalizes V_eps^L. By the uniqueness of the Phi^4_3 construction: any sequence of Gibbs measures with the SAME quartic coupling, the SAME mass counterterm, and additional smooth bounded perturbations (the terms -2 delta_m_eps^2 psi_eps phi_eps + delta_m_eps^2 psi_eps^2 are absorbed into the linear coupling and normalization) converges weakly to the SAME limit mu. Therefore mu* = mu, and the full sequence mu_eps^L -\u003e mu weakly.
