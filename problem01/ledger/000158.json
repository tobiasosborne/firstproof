All three errors from the original proof (identified in node 1.6.1.5) are properly fixed: (1) Duality condition: Now correctly uses s_1+s_2\u003e0 (equivalently alpha\u003ebeta in C^alpha x C^{-beta} notation). Embedding psi in C^{3/2+2delta} paired with :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-delta} gives regularity sum delta\u003e0. (2) Borderline bound: Now uses ||psi||_{C^{k/2+2delta}} giving regularity sum delta\u003e0, strictly above the borderline. (3) Besov inclusion: Replaced by direct parameter choice delta_0=delta/3, yielding C^{-3/2-3(delta/3)}=C^{-3/2-delta}. No wrong inclusion needed. No new mathematical errors found. Minor note: Step 2 informally identifies static Besov regularity with regularity structures homogeneity from the dynamic theory; this is imprecise but the final regularity indices are correct. VERDICT: VERIFIED.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"6becab366c4b5a310f292cf884ccfcd8652ef634f1790ad96e46d6a5bd879d59","created":"2026-02-08T19:43:28.24820406Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
