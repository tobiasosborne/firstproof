The proof does not explicitly note that M depends on f only through spatial L^p norms, and ||psi_eps^j||_{L^p} \u003c= ||psi^j||_{L^p} by Young's convolution inequality, ensuring uniformity in eps. (2) The fourth term \u003c(-Delta+m^2)psi, phi\u003e pairs with the unregularized field phi, not with :phi_eps^1: = phi_eps. Node 1.6.2.10.2.4 bounds E_{mu_eps}[exp(alpha \u003cf, phi_eps\u003e)], not E_{mu_eps}[exp(alpha \u003cf, phi\u003e)]. The same BG partition function method gives the required bound for linear functionals of phi, but the proof does not distinguish these cases. Neither gap affects the validity of the conclusion.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
