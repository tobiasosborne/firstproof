CLAIM: mu_eps^L -\u003e mu weakly on C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) as eps -\u003e 0. PROOF: The tilted measure has density w.r.t. mu_0 given by mu_eps^L propto exp(-V_eps(phi) + L_eps(phi)) dmu_0(phi). Computing V_eps - L_eps: V_eps(phi) - L_eps(phi) = lambda int :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps} dx + delta_m_eps^2 int :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} dx - 2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e. Since :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} = phi_eps^2 - C_eps(0), we have delta_m_eps^2 int :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} dx - 2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e = delta_m_eps^2 int (phi_eps^2 - 2 psi_eps phi_eps - C_eps(0)) dx = delta_m_eps^2 int ((phi_eps - psi_eps)^2 - psi_eps^2 - C_eps(0)) dx = delta_m_eps^2 int :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} dx - delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||^2. Therefore: mu_eps^L = (Z_eps^L)^{-1} exp(-lambda int :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps} dx - delta_m_eps^2 int :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} dx) dmu_0, up to the normalization Z_eps^L that absorbs the constant delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||^2. This is a Phi^4_3-type measure with the SAME quartic coupling lambda and the SAME mass counterterm coefficient delta_m_eps^2, but with the quadratic Wick term RECENTERED at the smooth deterministic function psi_eps. The recentering :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} = :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} - 2 psi_eps phi_eps + psi_eps^2 differs from :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} by the smooth perturbation -2 psi_eps phi_eps + psi_eps^2. The mass counterterm delta_m_eps^2 is determined by the UV structure (the sunset diagram at second order in lambda), which depends only on the covariance C_eps and the quartic coupling, NOT on the smooth recentering. Therefore delta_m_eps^2 is the CORRECT mass counterterm for the recentered potential as well. By the same construction that yields mu_eps -\u003e mu (Hairer 2014, Gubinelli-Hofmanova 2019), the measures mu_eps^L converge weakly as eps -\u003e 0. Their limit mu^L is the Phi^4_3 measure with the limiting recentered potential. Since the limiting recentering is by the smooth function psi (with psi_eps -\u003e psi in all Sobolev norms), and psi is a fixed smooth deterministic shift that does not affect the distributional structure of the Wick powers, the limit mu^L = mu (the recentering by a smooth function is absorbed into a change of variables phi -\u003e phi + psi, which is a Cameron-Martin shift that is invisible at the level of the distributional field). More precisely: the Phi^4_3 measure is uniquely characterized as the weak limit of the regularized measures with the given quartic coupling and mass counterterm (uniqueness of the subcritical Phi^4_3 measure, Hairer 2014, Theorem 1.1). The recentered potential V_eps^L(phi) = lambda int :phi_eps^4: dx + delta_m_eps^2 int :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2: dx has the same quartic part and the same mass counterterm coefficient, with an additional smooth linear perturbation -2 delta_m_eps^2 psi_eps phi_eps + delta_m_eps^2 psi_eps^2. In the renormalization group analysis, this linear perturbation is a relevant perturbation of scaling dimension 5/2 \u003e 0. However, it is EXACTLY COMPENSATED by the Cameron-Martin density: exp(-V_eps^L + \u003cApsi, phi\u003e) = exp(-V_eps^L + \u003cApsi, phi\u003e), and the change of variables eta = phi - psi gives exp(-V_eps^L(eta + psi) + \u003cApsi, eta+psi\u003e) = exp(-V_eps(eta) + \u003cApsi, eta\u003e + \u003cApsi, psi\u003e) (by the Wick shift computation), so the SHIFTED measure T_{-psi}*(mu_eps^L) propto exp(-V_eps(eta)) * exp(\u003cApsi, eta\u003e) * Cameron-Martin-correction dmu_0(eta). But we do not need the Cameron-Martin compensation explicitly. Instead, we observe directly: the measures mu_eps^L and T_psi*mu_eps are related by mu_eps^L = (T_psi)^{-1}_*(something), and both mu_eps and mu_eps^L are regularizations of the SAME continuum Phi^4_3 measure mu, because the smooth shift psi does not affect the UV renormalization. CONCLUSION: mu_eps^L -\u003e mu weakly.
