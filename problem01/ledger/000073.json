Since psi in C^inf(T^3) and T^3 is a compact manifold without boundary, psi in H^s(T^3) for all s \u003e= 0; in particular psi in H^1(T^3). By the Cameron-Martin theorem (Bogachev, Gaussian Measures, 1998, Theorem 2.6.4), the translation T_psi: phi -\u003e phi + psi satisfies T_psi* mu_0 ~ mu_0 with Radon-Nikodym derivative d(T_psi* mu_0)/d(mu_0)(phi) = exp(\u003c(-Delta+m^2)psi, phi\u003e_{L^2} - (1/2)||psi||^2_{H^1}), which is mu_0-a.e. finite and strictly positive.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"bd4e7a335c5f6876f1712a13e2919327909b31525d5be3f37b49df94b259f839","created":"2026-02-08T18:38:19.896714848Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
