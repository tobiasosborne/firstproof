But node 1.6.2.10 is the PARENT node whose children (including this node 1.6.2.10.1) are supposed to collectively prove the parent's claim. A child node cannot invoke its parent's conclusion as a premise — this is circular. Specifically: node 1.6.2.10 claims sup_eps E_{mu_eps}[||:phi_eps^k:||^p] \u003c infinity. Node 1.6.2.10.1 is one of the children that should contribute to proving this. But 1.6.2.10.1's Step A.3 ASSUMES the parent's conclusion to establish its own claim, creating a dependency cycle.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
