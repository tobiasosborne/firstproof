This is a sum of four terms, each of the form c_j \u003cf_j, :phi^{k_j}:\u003e with c_j in R, f_j in C^inf(T^3), and k_j in {1, 2, 3}. For any alpha in R: alpha Psi^{ren} = sum_{j=1}^4 (alpha c_j) \u003cf_j, :phi^{k_j}:\u003e. By the elementary inequality exp(a_1 + ... + a_4) \u003c= exp(4 a_1) ^{1/4} ... exp(4 a_4)^{1/4} (Holder with exponents (4,4,4,4)): E_mu[exp(alpha Psi^{ren})] \u003c= prod_{j=1}^4 (E_mu[exp(4 alpha c_j \u003cf_j, :phi^{k_j}:\u003e)])^{1/4}. Each factor is finite: for k_j in {2,3}, the exponential integrability E_mu[exp(beta \u003cf_j, :phi^{k_j}:\u003e)] \u003c infinity for all beta in R is established in node 1.6.2.10.3 (validated). For k_j = 1, the sub-Gaussian bound E_mu[exp(beta \u003cf_j, phi\u003e)] \u003c infinity for all beta in R is established in node 1.6.2.5 (validated). Therefore E_mu[exp(alpha Psi^{ren})] \u003c infinity for all alpha in R.\n\nPROOF OF (a): Taking alpha = 1 in (c) gives Z = E_mu[exp(Psi^{ren})] \u003c infinity. For Z \u003e 0: since exp(Psi^{ren}(phi)) \u003e 0 for all phi (the exponential is always positive), and Psi^{ren} is mu-a.s. finite (it is in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1 by node 1.5.3, so finite mu-a.s.), we have exp(Psi^{ren}) \u003e 0 mu-a.s. Since E_mu[exp(Psi^{ren})] \u003c infinity and exp(Psi^{ren}) \u003e 0 mu-a.s., it follows that Z \u003e 0.\n\nPROOF OF (b): E_mu[R] = E_mu[exp(Psi^{ren})/Z] = Z/Z = 1 by definition.\n\nNOTE: This construction of R uses ONLY the limiting measure mu and the limiting renormalized exponent Psi^{ren}. The divergent terms L_eps and K_eps are NOT present in the limit -- they have been absorbed into the renormalization. The normalization Z plays the role of the limiting version of exp(-K_eps) = E_{mu_eps}[exp(Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps)].\n\nDEPENDENCIES: Nodes 1.6.2.10.3, 1.6.2.5, 1.5.3, 1.5.1.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"b27183df7a5ec0cfea2808a20ff78e0265a610caa3840ebe706e8a3b8e7446d1","created":"2026-02-08T22:05:35.214099278Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
