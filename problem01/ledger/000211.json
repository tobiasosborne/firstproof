The construction (Hairer 2014, Gubinelli-Hofmanova 2019, Mourrat-Weber 2017) proceeds by:\n\n(i) Defining the regularized measures mu_eps on C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3), each carrying enhanced data (phi_eps, :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps}, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}).\n\n(ii) Establishing UNIFORM-IN-EPS moment bounds for the enhanced data in Besov spaces. Specifically, the stochastic estimates (Hairer 2014, Section 10; Gubinelli-Hofmanova 2019, Proposition 3.1) show that for every p \u003e= 1 and delta \u003e 0:\n\n  sup_{eps \u003e 0} E_{mu_eps}[ || :phi_eps^k:_{C_eps} ||_{C^{-k/2-delta}}^p ] \u003c infinity.\n\n(iii) Using these uniform bounds to establish TIGHTNESS of the family {mu_eps} (viewed as measures on the enhanced data space), and extracting a convergent subsequence whose limit is mu.\n\nThe uniform L^p bounds in (ii) are not an afterthought; they are THE CORE of the construction. Without them, tightness fails and the limiting measure does not exist.\n\nCRUCIAL POINT: These bounds concern the Wick powers :phi_eps^k:_{C_eps} treated as SINGLE distributional objects in C^{-k/2-delta}(T^3). At no point do we decompose Wick powers into raw powers (which would introduce divergent C_eps(0) terms). The bounds are established by stochastic-analytic methods (regularity structures / paracontrolled distributions / Schauder estimates) that keep the Wick renormalization intact.\n\nThis node depends on node 1.6.1 (validated), which establishes that the Wick powers are well-defined elements of the stated Besov spaces.\n\nREFERENCES: Hairer (2014), Section 10 (bounds on the stochastic objects); Gubinelli-Hofmanova (2019), Proposition 3.1 (uniform estimates for regularized model); Mourrat-Weber (2017), Theorem 1.1 (global well-posedness and moment bounds); node 1.6.1 (validated).","inference":"modus_ponens","dependencies":["1.6.1"],"workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"623709b12112b874d0664576b9c27ef54a8c0aa49aea6aa0271c7b9a909b1e7c","created":"2026-02-08T20:13:32.585161813Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
