Node 1.6.2.2 and 1.6.2.3 both reference node 1.6.1 (convergence of Wick powers) for the L^p convergence needed in the Fatou argument. Node 1.6.2 should formally declare dependencies on: (1) node 1.6.1 (well-definedness and L^p convergence of Wick powers), (2) the Barashkov-Gubinelli sub-Gaussian results (external reference). Additionally, the circular dependency with 1.5.4 must be resolved: if 1.5.4 depends on 1.6.2, and 1.6.2's proof references structures set up in 1.5.x, this creates a logical circle that must be explicitly broken.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
