Neither BG (2021) Section 2 nor Barashkov's thesis Chapter 3 states an explicit stability theorem of this form. The stability is a consequence of their methodology (specifically, the Boue-Dupuis variational approach where the upper bound depends only on the quartic coupling and bounded lower-order terms). The citation should say 'By the methods of BG (2021)' rather than citing specific sections as if they contain a named stability result.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
