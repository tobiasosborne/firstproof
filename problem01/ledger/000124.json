The proof invokes it at multiple points in Part III (the 'ExpInt-Psi' bound and the claim that exp(alpha|Psi_eps^{ren}|) is uniformly integrable). (2) Nodes 1.5.1, 1.5.2, 1.5.3, 1.4.4, and 1.2, all listed in the Prerequisites section. These should be declared as formal dependencies in the af system. The dependency on unvalidated node 1.6.2 is particularly problematic: it creates a logical circularity risk where Part III's claims depend on an unverified result. The proof labels 1.6.2 as 'anticipated' but does not provide an independent argument.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
