The limit satisfies E_mu[R] = lim E_{mu_eps}[R_eps] = 1. For any bounded continuous test functional F: E_{T_psi* mu}[F] = lim E_{T_psi* mu_eps}[F] = lim E_{mu_eps}[F R_eps] = E_mu[F R], confirming that T_psi* mu has density R w.r.t. mu.","new_statement":"(Passage to the limit — identification of T_psi*mu with the tilted measure) We show T_psi*mu = rho := (exp(Psi^{ren})/Z) dmu, establishing T_psi*mu \u003c\u003c mu with the stated Radon-Nikodym derivative R = exp(Psi^{ren})/Z. The proof proceeds in four steps: (1) Define rho and confirm it is a well-defined probability measure (node 1.6.3.3). (2) Rewrite the regularized identity in Boltzmann ratio form and identify the exponential tilt by L_eps as a recentering of the mass counterterm. (3) Show that the recentered Phi^4_3 measures mu_eps^L converge weakly to mu (same limit as mu_eps), by universality of the Phi^4_3 construction under smooth deterministic centering. (4) Combine (2) and (3) with Vitali convergence (node 1.6.3.8) to pass the Boltzmann ratio to the limit, yielding T_psi*mu = rho.
