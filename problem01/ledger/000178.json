This summary obscures the critical failure in nodes 1.6.2.2 and 1.6.2.3: the quartic domination works at the POINTWISE level for RAW powers, but the proof must handle WICK-ordered quantities. The Wick-to-raw conversion introduces eps-dependent constants (C_eps(0) ~ 1/eps) that produce divergent remainders when absorbed by Young's inequality. The quartic domination strategy is sound in principle, but the proof as executed in the children does not achieve eps-uniform bounds, so this QED is premature. The passage to the limit via Fatou is also incorrectly formulated (mixing measures mu_eps and mu). Until nodes 1.6.2.2 and 1.6.2.3 are repaired, this synthesis cannot stand.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
