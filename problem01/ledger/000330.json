(2) The BG (2020) Boue-Dupuis methodology for partition function bounds (used implicitly for the claim that V_eps^L gives a well-defined measure). (3) Cameron-Martin theorem (used implicitly in the completing-the-square rewriting). (4) The Skorokhod representation theorem (used in Step 4). None of these are formally declared.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
