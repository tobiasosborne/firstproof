The perturbation has degree k \u003c= 3 \u003c 4 and does NOT affect the quartic coupling.\n\n(P2) SMOOTH COEFFICIENTS: f is in C^inf(T^3) by hypothesis; all other coefficients are constants.\n\n(P3) MASS COUNTERTERM: delta_m_eps^2 is the same as in V_eps. When k=2, the shift -alpha f(x) is bounded, smooth, and eps-independent. The BG Polchinski flow handles the logarithmically divergent mass counterterm; an eps-independent bounded perturbation does not affect the flow.\n\n(P4) CUBIC IRRELEVANCE (k=3): The cubic term -alpha int f :phi_eps^3: dx is irrelevant in the RG sense. The integrated cubic has negative effective dimension. Irrelevant couplings flow to zero under the Polchinski RG (BG 2020, Section 4, Proposition 4.1).\n\nCONCLUSION: V_eps^{(alpha)} satisfies all requirements for the BG Polchinski flow analysis.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"a1c0730476b46cd74481a8b3c860e03c8bac121a671da78c98a2b4bef8bb9cea","created":"2026-02-08T21:03:59.449519002Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
