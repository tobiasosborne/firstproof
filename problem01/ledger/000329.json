This claim is stated without proof or citation. In phi^4_3 theory, the superficial degree of divergence for a 1PI graph with E external legs is delta = 3 - E/2. For E=1: delta = 5/2 \u003e 0, which IS superficially divergent. The claim that one-point insertions are finite after mass renormalization requires justification: (a) In the standard phi^4 theory with Z_2 symmetry, odd one-point functions vanish by symmetry. But V_eps^L BREAKS Z_2 symmetry (the recentering around psi). (b) The argument that 'one-point insertions are finite after mass renormalization' conflates two different things: the finiteness of the renormalized one-point function (which requires summing all diagrams) with the statement that no NEW counterterms are needed. The node needs to either cite a specific theorem or provide a power-counting argument.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
