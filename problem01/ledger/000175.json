Additionally, even if Fatou were applicable, Step 2 shows the bound involves terms like -(lambda/2) int phi_eps^4 + 6 lambda C_eps(0) int phi_eps^2 - delta_m^2 int :phi_eps^2:. After counterterm absorption, the remaining constant includes contributions from the Wick-to-raw conversion of :phi_eps^4: that are O(C_eps(0)^2) ~ O(eps^{-2}), which diverge. The claim that the RHS is 'C(alpha, f, lambda) \u003c infinity' uniformly in eps is false; it grows as exp(C/eps^2) at best.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
