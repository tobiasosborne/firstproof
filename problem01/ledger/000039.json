The limit satisfies E_mu[R] = lim E_{mu_eps}[R_eps] = 1. For any bounded continuous test functional F: E_{T_psi* mu}[F] = lim E_{T_psi* mu_eps}[F] = lim E_{mu_eps}[F R_eps] = E_mu[F R], confirming that T_psi* mu has density R w.r.t. mu.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"4202267b4897456a5ef40a6335685f6a713636730eb66d3059a2544e7b9e66fe","created":"2026-02-08T14:41:03.33190232Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
