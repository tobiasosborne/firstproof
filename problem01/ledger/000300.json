That is, for every bounded measurable G on X:\n\n  E_{nu_eps}[G] = E_{mu_eps}[G(phi+psi)] -\u003e E_mu[G(phi) exp(Psi^{ren}(phi)) / Z] = E_{nu}[G].\n\nIn particular, T_psi*mu \u003c\u003c mu with Radon-Nikodym derivative R = exp(Psi^{ren})/Z, and E_mu[R] = 1.\n\nPROOF:\n\nSTEP A (Reformulation on Skorokhod space): On the Skorokhod space (Omega, F, P) from node 1.6.3.2:\n\n  E_{mu_eps}[G(phi+psi)] = E_P[G(Phi_eps + psi)].\n\nSince Phi_eps -\u003e Phi P-a.s. and G(dot + psi) is continuous (psi is fixed smooth), dominated convergence gives:\n\n  E_P[G(Phi_eps + psi)] -\u003e E_P[G(Phi + psi)] = E_mu[G(phi+psi)].   ...(LIM-LHS)\n\nSTEP B (Regularized identity as a ratio): By node 1.5.2 (validated), for each eps:\n\n  E_{mu_eps}[G(phi+psi)] = E_{mu_eps}[G(phi) R_eps(phi)] = E_{mu_eps}[G exp(Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps)] / E_{mu_eps}[exp(Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps)].\n\nOn the Skorokhod space, define:\n  N_eps(G) := E_P[G(Phi_eps) exp(Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps) + L_eps(Phi_eps))]   (numerator)\n  D_eps := E_P[exp(Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps) + L_eps(Phi_eps))]   (denominator)\n\nThen E_{mu_eps}[G(phi+psi)] = N_eps(G) / D_eps.\n\nSTEP C (The L_eps tilt as a change of measure on the Skorokhod space): Define the probability measure P_eps on (Omega, F) by:\n\n  dP_eps / dP = exp(L_eps(Phi_eps)) / E_P[exp(L_eps(Phi_eps))]\n\nThis is well-defined because L_eps(Phi_eps) = 2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, (Phi_eps)_eps\u003e is a linear functional of Phi_eps, and under mu_eps (hence under P via the Skorokhod coupling) it has sub-Gaussian tails uniformly in eps (node 1.5.4, validated), so exp(L_eps(Phi_eps)) is in L^p(P) for every p. In particular, P_eps \u003c\u003c P.\n\nThen: N_eps(G) = E_P[exp(L_eps(Phi_eps))] * E_{P_eps}[G(Phi_eps) exp(Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps))]\n       D_eps  = E_P[exp(L_eps(Phi_eps))] * E_{P_eps}[exp(Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps))]\n\nand the ratio N_eps(G)/D_eps = E_{P_eps}[G(Phi_eps) exp(Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps))] / E_{P_eps}[exp(Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps))].\n\nSTEP D (Contiguity of P_eps and P): We show that the P_eps tilt has a NEGLIGIBLE effect on expectations of exp(Psi_eps^{ren}) in the limit. This is the key step. We claim:\n\n  |N_eps(G)/D_eps - E_P[G(Phi_eps) exp(Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps))] / E_P[exp(Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps))]| -\u003e 0.\n\nThat is, replacing P_eps by P in the ratio changes the limit by zero.\n\nPROOF BY CORRELATION DECAY: Write H_eps := L_eps(Phi_eps) - E_P[L_eps(Phi_eps)] (centered version). Then dP_eps/dP = exp(H_eps + c_eps) / E_P[exp(H_eps + c_eps)] for a constant c_eps. The deviation of the ratio under P_eps from the ratio under P is controlled by the covariance between exp(H_eps) and G(Phi_eps) exp(Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps)) under P.\n\nBy Cauchy-Schwarz: |E_{P_eps}[F] - E_P[F]| \u003c= ||F||_{L^2(P)} * ||dP_eps/dP - 1||_{L^2(P)} for any F with ||F||_{L^2(P)} \u003c infinity.\n\nNow, ||dP_eps/dP - 1||_{L^2(P)} = (E_P[(dP_eps/dP)^2] - 1)^{1/2}. We have:\n  E_P[(dP_eps/dP)^2] = E_P[exp(2 L_eps(Phi_eps))] / (E_P[exp(L_eps(Phi_eps))])^2.\n\nUnder mu_eps (hence under P): L_eps(Phi_eps) = 2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, (Phi_eps)_eps\u003e has sub-Gaussian distribution with variance proxy sigma_eps^2 = 4 (delta_m_eps^2)^2 ||psi||_{H^{-1}}^2 (node 1.5.4). For a sub-Gaussian random variable X with variance proxy sigma^2: E[exp(2X)] / (E[exp(X)])^2 = exp(sigma^2) (exact for Gaussian, asymptotic for sub-Gaussian). So ||dP_eps/dP - 1||_{L^2(P)}^2 ~ exp(sigma_eps^2) - 1 = exp(4 (delta_m_eps^2)^2 ||psi||_{H^{-1}}^2) - 1 -\u003e infinity.\n\nThis means the L^2 control FAILS -- the P_eps tilt is NOT close to P in L^2. The Cauchy-Schwarz approach does not work because the tilt is too large.\n\nSTEP E (CORRECT APPROACH -- Bypass the L_eps issue entirely): Since the Cauchy-Schwarz approach fails (the L_eps tilt is genuinely large), we use a fundamentally different argument. We establish the identity nu = rho (i.e., T_psi*mu = exp(Psi^{ren})/Z dmu) WITHOUT passing through the regularized ratios.\n\nSTEP E.1 (Weak convergence gives nu_eps -\u003e T_psi*mu): As established in Step A, nu_eps := T_psi*mu_eps -\u003e T_psi*mu weakly.\n\nSTEP E.2 (Weak convergence gives rho_eps -\u003e rho): As established in node 1.6.3.5 Steps 1-2, rho_eps := exp(Psi_eps^{ren})/Z_eps^{(0)} * mu_eps -\u003e rho := exp(Psi^{ren})/Z * mu weakly (by Vitali convergence on the Skorokhod space).\n\nSTEP E.3 (Total variation distance between nu_eps and rho_eps -\u003e 0): We show ||nu_eps - rho_eps||_TV -\u003e 0. Since both converge weakly and weak limits are unique, this would give nu = rho.\n\nFor each eps: ||nu_eps - rho_eps||_TV = (1/2) E_{mu_eps}[|R_eps - exp(Psi_eps^{ren})/Z_eps^{(0)}|].\n\nNow, R_eps = exp(Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps + K_eps) = exp(Psi_eps^{ren}) * exp(L_eps + K_eps), and exp(Psi_eps^{ren})/Z_eps^{(0)} is the density without L_eps. The ratio R_eps / (exp(Psi_eps^{ren})/Z_eps^{(0)}) = Z_eps^{(0)} * exp(L_eps + K_eps) = exp(L_eps + K_eps + log Z_eps^{(0)}). This is NOT close to 1.\n\nSo ||nu_eps - rho_eps||_TV is NOT small -- the two families of measures genuinely differ at each eps. The identification nu = rho relies on both having the SAME weak limit despite differing at each eps. But uniqueness of weak limits ensures: if nu_eps -\u003e nu and rho_eps -\u003e rho, and nu_eps -\u003e nu' for any subsequence, then nu = nu'. Similarly rho = rho'. But this does NOT give nu = rho.\n\nSTEP E.4 (THE CORRECT IDENTIFICATION): We need a direct proof that T_psi*mu \u003c\u003c mu with density exp(Psi^{ren})/Z. This cannot be deduced purely from the regularized approximation because the L_eps tilt introduces a correction that is large at each eps but whose effect disappears in the limit.\n\nThe correct argument uses the VARIATIONAL CHARACTERIZATION of mu (Barashkov-Gubinelli 2020). Define the Gibbs variational functional:\n  H(nu | mu_0) + E_nu[V] for probability measures nu on X\nwhere H is the relative entropy w.r.t. the GFF mu_0 and V is the interaction potential. BG (2020) show that mu minimizes this functional and is its unique minimizer.\n\nFor the shifted measure T_psi*mu: the shift by psi changes the potential from V(phi) to V(phi-psi). The difference V(phi) - V(phi-psi) = -Delta V(phi) = Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps + K_eps (at the regularized level). In the renormalized limit, the effective potential difference is Psi^{ren}(phi) (the L_eps and K_eps are absorbed into the renormalization).\n\nBy the Gibbs variational principle: T_psi*mu is the unique probability measure minimizing H(nu | mu_0) + E_nu[V(phi-psi)]. Since V(phi-psi) = V(phi) - Psi^{ren}(phi) + (lower order renormalization absorbed terms), the minimizer of H(nu | mu_0) + E_nu[V(phi) - Psi^{ren}(phi)] is nu = exp(Psi^{ren}) / Z * mu (by the tilting formula for Gibbs measures).\n\nThis argument is correct in spirit but requires rigorous justification of the variational formula in the infinite-dimensional setting. Rather than developing this here, we DEFER the full identification to node 1.6.4 and state the following CLEAN result for this node:\n\nCONCLUSION FOR NODE 1.6.3 (WHAT WE HAVE PROVED):\n\n(I) The probability measures rho_eps := exp(Psi_eps^{ren})/Z_eps^{(0)} dmu_eps converge weakly to rho := exp(Psi^{ren})/Z dmu, where Z = E_mu[exp(Psi^{ren})] in (0, infinity). This convergence is established by Vitali's theorem on the Skorokhod coupling space. (Nodes 1.6.3.2, 1.6.3.3, 1.6.3.4, 1.6.3.5.)\n\n(II) The probability measures nu_eps := T_psi*mu_eps converge weakly to nu := T_psi*mu. This follows from the continuous mapping theorem. (Node 1.6.3.2.)\n\n(III) rho is a well-defined probability measure, absolutely continuous w.r.t. mu, with density R = exp(Psi^{ren})/Z satisfying E_mu[R] = 1 and R \u003e 0 mu-a.s. (Node 1.6.3.3.)\n\nThe identification nu = rho (i.e., T_psi*mu = exp(Psi^{ren})/Z * mu) is deferred to node 1.6.4.\n\nDEPENDENCIES: Nodes 1.6.3.2, 1.6.3.3, 1.6.3.4, 1.6.3.5, 1.5.4, 1.5.2.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"61d6dfc1d5e5018655c95634ac8b0471864c6114b8b0acc4f49431658c8c3e2d","created":"2026-02-08T22:09:06.476529063Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
