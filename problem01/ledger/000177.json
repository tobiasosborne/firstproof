If the children constitute a proof, the inference should be 'decomposition' or similar, not 'assumption'. If this is genuinely an assumption (taken without proof), then the children are decoration and the epistemic status should reflect that this is an unproven hypothesis. The current labeling is inconsistent.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
