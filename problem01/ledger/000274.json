The node cites: (1) 'BG (2020), Proposition 4.1' claiming it establishes running quartic coupling lambda_j \u003e= c_0*lambda at every RG scale. (2) 'BG (2020), Proposition 4.3' claiming it gives partition function bounds. These citations appear to be fabricated. In BG (2020) [Duke Math J. 169(17), 3339-3415], Section 4 concerns Gamma-convergence, NOT Polchinski flow of running couplings. The paper does not contain propositions tracking running quartic couplings through a scale-by-scale RG flow. The BG approach uses Boue-Dupuis variational formula + a priori estimates on stochastic objects (their Section 3), NOT a Polchinski flow with running couplings. The conclusions attributed to these non-existent propositions ARE correct (quartic coercivity is preserved, partition function is bounded), but they follow from the Boue-Dupuis variational analysis combined with uniform estimates, not from propositions about running couplings in an RG flow. Citing specific non-existent propositions makes the argument unverifiable against the source and constitutes a serious scholarly deficiency.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
