We work on the three-dimensional torus T^3 with dimension d = 3.\n\n=== Functional-Analytic Preliminaries ===\n\nWe recall the key regularity facts for the Phi^4_3 field theory on T^3 (d=3).\n\n(R1) Under the GFF mu_0 (and also under the Phi^4_3 measure mu, which lives in the same Besov-Hoelder regularity class), the random field phi belongs mu-a.s. to the Hoelder-Besov space C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) for every delta \u003e 0. This is the standard regularity of the GFF in d=3: the covariance kernel C(x,y) = (-Delta + m^2)^{-1}(x,y) has a singularity |x-y|^{-(d-2)} = |x-y|^{-1} in d=3, placing phi in C^{-d/2+1-delta} = C^{-1/2-delta}. [Ref: Hairer (2014), Sec. 10; Gubinelli-Imkeller-Perkowski (2015), Sec. 4.]\n\n(R2) The Wick powers :phi^k: are well-defined distributions (in the sense of Schwartz) on T^3 under mu, with the following regularities:\n  - :phi: = phi in C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3),\n  - :phi^2: in C^{-1-delta}(T^3),\n  - :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-delta}(T^3),\nfor every delta \u003e 0. These regularities follow from the general principle that Wick-ordering a k-th power of a field of regularity alpha yields a distribution of regularity k*alpha (heuristically), made rigorous by regularity structures (Hairer 2014, Thm 10.7) and paracontrolled distributions (Gubinelli-Imkeller-Perkowski 2015, Thm 1.1). The precise statement is that :phi^k: belongs to C^{k(-1/2-delta')+delta''} for suitable delta', delta'' \u003e 0, which for k=2 gives C^{-1-delta} and for k=3 gives C^{-3/2-delta}.\n\n(R3) Mollification and convergence. Let rho_eps be a standard mollifier on T^3 and f_eps = rho_eps * f for any distribution f. Then:\n  - If f in C^alpha(T^3), then f_eps -\u003e f in C^alpha(T^3) as eps -\u003e 0.\n  - If g in C^inf(T^3), then g_eps -\u003e g in C^beta(T^3) for every beta \u003e 0 (in fact in C^inf).\n  - The Wick powers :phi_eps^k:_{C_eps} of the mollified field converge: :phi_eps^k:_{C_eps} -\u003e :phi^k: in C^{k(-1/2)-delta}(T^3) as eps -\u003e 0, mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1. This is a fundamental result of the regularity structures / paracontrolled theory.\n\n(R4) Duality pairing. For alpha \u003e 0, the duality pairing \u003cf, g\u003e = integral_{T^3} f(x) g(x) dx is well-defined and continuous as a bilinear map C^alpha(T^3) x C^{-alpha+delta}(T^3) -\u003e R for any delta \u003e 0 with alpha - delta \u003e 0. More precisely, if f in C^alpha and g in C^{-beta} with alpha \u003e beta, then |\u003cf, g\u003e| \u003c= C ||f||_{C^alpha} ||g||_{C^{-beta}}, and the pairing is jointly continuous.\n\n=== PART (a): Convergence of the Cubic Term ===\n\nClaim: As eps -\u003e 0, integral_{T^3} psi_eps(x) :phi_eps^3(x):_{C_eps} dx -\u003e integral_{T^3} psi(x) :phi^3(x): dx, where convergence holds mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.\n\nProof of Part (a):\n\nWe write the cubic term as the duality pairing \u003cpsi_eps, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}\u003e. We must show this converges to \u003cpsi, :phi^3:\u003e.\n\nStep (a.1): Regularity of the test function. Since psi in C^inf(T^3), we have psi in C^alpha(T^3) for every alpha \u003e 0. In particular, psi in C^{3/2+2delta}(T^3) for any delta \u003e 0. Similarly, psi_eps = rho_eps * psi in C^inf(T^3), and psi_eps -\u003e psi in C^beta(T^3) for every beta \u003e 0. In particular, ||psi_eps - psi||_{C^{3/2+2delta}} -\u003e 0 as eps -\u003e 0.\n\nStep (a.2): Regularity of the Wick cube. By (R2) and (R3), :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps} -\u003e :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-delta}(T^3), mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.\n\nStep (a.3): The duality pairing is well-defined and continuous. We apply (R4) with alpha = 3/2 + 2*delta and beta = 3/2 + delta. Since alpha \u003e beta (as 2*delta \u003e delta for delta \u003e 0), the pairing C^{3/2+2delta} x C^{-3/2-delta} -\u003e R is continuous. Explicitly:\n\n|\u003cpsi_eps, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}\u003e - \u003cpsi, :phi^3:\u003e|\n  = |\u003cpsi_eps, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}\u003e - \u003cpsi, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}\u003e + \u003cpsi, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}\u003e - \u003cpsi, :phi^3:\u003e|\n  \u003c= |\u003cpsi_eps - psi, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}\u003e| + |\u003cpsi, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps} - :phi^3:\u003e|.\n\nFor the first term: by (R4),\n  |\u003cpsi_eps - psi, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}\u003e| \u003c= C ||psi_eps - psi||_{C^{3/2+2delta}} ||:phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}||_{C^{-3/2-delta}}.\nThe first factor -\u003e 0 by Step (a.1). The second factor is bounded (uniformly in eps) since :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps} converges in C^{-3/2-delta}, hence is bounded in that norm for eps small enough.\n\nFor the second term: by (R4),\n  |\u003cpsi, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps} - :phi^3:\u003e| \u003c= C ||psi||_{C^{3/2+2delta}} ||:phi_eps^3:_{C_eps} - :phi^3:||_{C^{-3/2-delta}}.\nThe first factor is a fixed finite constant. The second factor -\u003e 0 by Step (a.2).\n\nTherefore \u003cpsi_eps, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}\u003e -\u003e \u003cpsi, :phi^3:\u003e as eps -\u003e 0. The convergence holds mu-a.s. (since both (a.1) and (a.2) hold mu-a.s.) and in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1 (since :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps} converges in L^p(mu; C^{-3/2-delta}) by the regularity theory).\n\nConclusion for (a): The cubic term -4 lambda \u003cpsi_eps, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}\u003e converges to -4 lambda \u003cpsi, :phi^3:\u003e, which is a FINITE, well-defined random variable under mu. NO UV divergence arises. QED (a).\n\n=== PART (b): Convergence of the Quadratic Term ===\n\nClaim: As eps -\u003e 0, integral_{T^3} psi_eps^2(x) :phi_eps^2(x):_{C_eps} dx -\u003e integral_{T^3} psi^2(x) :phi^2(x): dx, where convergence holds mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.\n\nProof of Part (b):\n\nThe argument is strictly analogous to Part (a), but with better regularity margins.\n\nStep (b.1): The test function psi^2 in C^inf(T^3) (since psi in C^inf and C^inf is an algebra). Hence psi^2 in C^{1+2delta}(T^3) for any delta \u003e 0, and psi_eps^2 -\u003e psi^2 in C^{1+2delta}(T^3).\n\nStep (b.2): By (R2) and (R3), :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} -\u003e :phi^2: in C^{-1-delta}(T^3), mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu).\n\nStep (b.3): The pairing C^{1+2delta} x C^{-1-delta} -\u003e R is continuous by (R4), since 1+2*delta \u003e 1+delta for delta \u003e 0. The estimate proceeds identically to Part (a):\n\n|\u003cpsi_eps^2, :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps}\u003e - \u003cpsi^2, :phi^2:\u003e|\n  \u003c= |\u003cpsi_eps^2 - psi^2, :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps}\u003e| + |\u003cpsi^2, :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} - :phi^2:\u003e|\n  -\u003e 0 as eps -\u003e 0.\n\nNote: The regularity margin is even more favorable here than in Part (a). The Wick square :phi^2: in C^{-1-delta} has better regularity than the Wick cube :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-delta}, so the pairing with the smooth test function psi^2 has a larger positive gap (1+2*delta) - (1+delta) = delta \u003e 0.\n\nConclusion for (b): The quadratic term 6 lambda \u003cpsi_eps^2, :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps}\u003e converges to 6 lambda \u003cpsi^2, :phi^2:\u003e, which is FINITE. NO UV divergence arises. QED (b).\n\n=== PART (c): Linear Term — Convergence and Divergence ===\n\nThe linear contribution from DeltaV_eps consists of two terms (from Node 1.4.3):\n  (c.i) -4 lambda \u003cpsi_eps^3, phi_eps\u003e, and\n  (c.ii) -2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e.\nWe analyze each separately.\n\n--- Part (c.i): Convergence of \u003cpsi_eps^3, phi_eps\u003e ---\n\nClaim: \u003cpsi_eps^3, phi_eps\u003e -\u003e \u003cpsi^3, phi\u003e as eps -\u003e 0, and the limit is finite mu-a.s.\n\nProof: Since psi in C^inf, we have psi^3 in C^inf (C^inf is closed under multiplication). In particular psi^3 in C^{1/2+2delta}(T^3) for any delta \u003e 0, and psi_eps^3 -\u003e psi^3 in C^{1/2+2delta}(T^3). By (R1), phi in C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) mu-a.s., and phi_eps -\u003e phi in C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3). The duality pairing C^{1/2+2delta} x C^{-1/2-delta} -\u003e R is continuous by (R4) (since 1/2+2*delta \u003e 1/2+delta for delta \u003e 0). The same triangle-inequality argument as in Parts (a)-(b) gives:\n\n|\u003cpsi_eps^3, phi_eps\u003e - \u003cpsi^3, phi\u003e|\n  \u003c= |\u003cpsi_eps^3 - psi^3, phi_eps\u003e| + |\u003cpsi^3, phi_eps - phi\u003e|\n  -\u003e 0 as eps -\u003e 0, mu-a.s.\n\nHence -4 lambda \u003cpsi_eps^3, phi_eps\u003e -\u003e -4 lambda \u003cpsi^3, phi\u003e, which is finite. No divergence.\n\n--- Part (c.ii): Divergence of delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e ---\n\nClaim: 2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e diverges as eps -\u003e 0 (assuming psi is not identically zero and \u003cpsi, phi\u003e is non-zero mu-a.s.).\n\nProof: We analyze the two factors separately.\n\nFactor 1: \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e -\u003e \u003cpsi, phi\u003e. By the same argument as in (c.i) (with psi in place of psi^3), we have psi in C^inf subset C^{1/2+2delta} and phi in C^{-1/2-delta}, so \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e -\u003e \u003cpsi, phi\u003e. The limit \u003cpsi, phi\u003e is a well-defined finite random variable under mu (it is a continuous linear functional of phi). Moreover, for psi not identically zero, \u003cpsi, phi\u003e is a non-degenerate Gaussian random variable under mu_0 (and has a non-degenerate, though non-Gaussian, distribution under mu), so \u003cpsi, phi\u003e is nonzero mu-a.s.\n\nFactor 2: delta_m_eps^2 -\u003e +infinity. The mass counterterm is given by:\n  delta_m_eps^2 = c lambda^2 sum_{k in Z^3} (rho_hat_eps(k))^2 / (|k|^2 + m^2)^2 + O(lambda^3),\nwhere rho_hat_eps(k) = rho_hat(eps k) is the Fourier multiplier of the mollifier. The leading term is the second-order Feynman diagram (the \"tadpole\" or \"sunset\" contribution at zero external momentum). In d=3, this sum diverges logarithmically:\n  delta_m_eps^2 ~ c' lambda^2 log(1/eps) as eps -\u003e 0,\nwhere c' \u003e 0 is an explicit constant depending on the mollifier and the mass m. This logarithmic divergence is the standard mass renormalization in Phi^4_3 (see Hairer 2014, Sec. 10.5; Barashkov-Gubinelli 2020, Sec. 2.3).\n\nProduct: Since \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e -\u003e \u003cpsi, phi\u003e (a finite, generically nonzero random variable) and delta_m_eps^2 ~ c' lambda^2 log(1/eps) -\u003e +infinity, the product\n  2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e ~ 2 c' lambda^2 log(1/eps) * \u003cpsi, phi\u003e\ndiverges to +/- infinity (depending on the sign of \u003cpsi, phi\u003e, which varies from sample to sample).\n\nCrucially, this divergent term is LINEAR in phi: it equals 2 delta_m_eps^2 times the linear functional phi |-\u003e \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e = \u003crho_eps * psi, rho_eps * phi\u003e (which converges to the linear functional phi |-\u003e \u003cpsi, phi\u003e). It is therefore a FIELD-DEPENDENT divergence, meaning it cannot be absorbed into normalization alone. It must be handled by the exponential tilt / renormalization mechanism in Nodes 1.5 and 1.6.\n\nConclusion for (c): The linear contribution decomposes into a convergent piece (-4 lambda \u003cpsi^3, phi\u003e, finite) and a divergent piece (-2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi, phi\u003e, diverging as log(1/eps)). The divergent piece is field-dependent (linear in phi). QED (c).\n\n=== PART (d): Constant Terms ===\n\nThe constant (field-independent) contributions from DeltaV_eps are (from Node 1.4.3):\n  (d.i) lambda ||psi_eps||_4^4, and\n  (d.ii) delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||_2^2.\n\n--- Part (d.i): lambda ||psi_eps||_4^4 ---\n\nClaim: lambda ||psi_eps||_4^4 -\u003e lambda ||psi||_4^4 \u003c infinity.\n\nProof: Since psi in C^inf(T^3) subset L^4(T^3), and psi_eps = rho_eps * psi -\u003e psi in every L^p(T^3) (indeed in C^inf), we have ||psi_eps||_4^4 -\u003e ||psi||_4^4 by continuity of the L^4 norm. The limit is finite since psi is smooth on the compact torus T^3. This term is field-independent (it depends only on the fixed, deterministic function psi). No divergence.\n\n--- Part (d.ii): delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||_2^2 ---\n\nClaim: delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||_2^2 diverges as eps -\u003e 0 (for psi not identically zero), but is field-independent.\n\nProof: ||psi_eps||_2^2 -\u003e ||psi||_2^2 \u003e 0 (since psi is smooth, nonzero, on compact T^3). Meanwhile delta_m_eps^2 ~ c' lambda^2 log(1/eps) -\u003e +infinity. Therefore the product delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||_2^2 -\u003e +infinity.\n\nHowever, this divergent quantity is a CONSTANT — it does not depend on the stochastic field phi at all. It is a deterministic real number that diverges as eps -\u003e 0. In the Radon-Nikodym derivative R_eps = exp(Psi_eps), this term contributes a multiplicative factor exp(-delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||_2^2) (with a sign determined by the full decomposition in Node 1.5). Since R_eps must satisfy E_{mu_eps}[R_eps] = 1 (it is a Radon-Nikodym derivative), the normalization constant Z_eps = E_{mu_eps}[exp(Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps)] absorbs this divergent constant. The divergence of the constant is compensated by the normalization — this is the standard mechanism by which field-independent infinities are removed in QFT.\n\nConclusion for (d): lambda ||psi||_4^4 is finite. delta_m_eps^2 ||psi||_2^2 diverges but is field-independent, hence absorbed into normalization. QED (d).\n\n=== CONCLUSION: Classification of UV Divergences ===\n\nAssembling all four parts, we classify each term in DeltaV_eps by its eps -\u003e 0 behavior:\n\n  CONVERGENT and FIELD-DEPENDENT:\n    (a) -4 lambda \u003cpsi_eps, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}\u003e -\u003e -4 lambda \u003cpsi, :phi^3:\u003e (cubic in phi)\n    (b) +6 lambda \u003cpsi_eps^2, :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps}\u003e -\u003e +6 lambda \u003cpsi^2, :phi^2:\u003e (quadratic in phi)\n    (c.i) -4 lambda \u003cpsi_eps^3, phi_eps\u003e -\u003e -4 lambda \u003cpsi^3, phi\u003e (linear in phi)\n\n  CONVERGENT and FIELD-INDEPENDENT:\n    (d.i) lambda ||psi_eps||_4^4 -\u003e lambda ||psi||_4^4\n\n  DIVERGENT and FIELD-DEPENDENT:\n    (c.ii) -2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e ~ -2 c' lambda^2 log(1/eps) \u003cpsi, phi\u003e -\u003e -infinity * \u003cpsi, phi\u003e (linear in phi)\n\n  DIVERGENT and FIELD-INDEPENDENT:\n    (d.ii) delta_m_eps^2 ||psi_eps||_2^2 ~ c' lambda^2 log(1/eps) ||psi||_2^2 -\u003e +infinity (constant)\n\nThe ONLY UV-divergent contribution that depends on the field phi is the linear term:\n  L_eps(phi) = 2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e,\nwhich diverges as c' lambda^2 log(1/eps) * \u003cpsi, phi\u003e.\n\nAll Wick-power pairings (cubic and quadratic) converge because:\n  (1) The Wick powers :phi_eps^k:_{C_eps} converge in C^{-k/2-delta} (regularity structures theory);\n  (2) The smooth test functions psi, psi^2 provide sufficient positive regularity for the duality pairing;\n  (3) The duality C^{alpha} x C^{-beta} -\u003e R is continuous whenever alpha \u003e beta.\n\nThe divergent field-independent constant delta_m_eps^2 ||psi||_2^2 is absorbed into the normalization of the Radon-Nikodym derivative (as will be shown in Node 1.5).\n\nThis completes the proof of Node 1.4.4.
