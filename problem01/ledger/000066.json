{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-08T18:34:32.777995544Z","node_id":"1.4.4","note":"VERIFIED WITH CAVEATS. All four main conclusions of Node 1.4.4 are correct: (a) cubic term converges, (b) quadratic term converges, (c) linear term decomposes into convergent and divergent pieces, (d) constants are finite or field-independent. The overall classification of UV divergences is correct. Two minor issues filed as challenges: (1) the explicit Fourier formula for delta_m_eps^2 in Part (c.ii) is incorrect (the written single sum converges in d=3; the correct expression is the sunset diagram), though the asymptotic rate log(1/eps) used in the proof is correct; (2) the justification for \u003cpsi,phi\u003e \\!= 0 mu-a.s. is incomplete because mu PERP mu_0, but the conclusion is correct by full-support arguments. Neither issue affects the validity of the node's conclusions."}
