Moreover, the regularized densities converge in the following precise sense: for any bounded measurable G on the enhanced data space X, E_{mu_eps}[G * R_eps] -\u003e E_mu[G * R] as eps -\u003e 0.\n\nIMPORTANT CORRECTION: The original statement of this node claimed uniform integrability of {R_eps} via the de la Vallee-Poussin criterion and L^p bounds. This is WRONG: for any fixed p \u003e 1, E_{mu_eps}[R_eps^p] diverges as exp(C(p^2-1)(log 1/eps)^2) (established in node 1.5.4, validated). The L^p route to uniform integrability is BLOCKED. Instead, we use a direct Vitali convergence argument on the Skorokhod coupling space that avoids L^p bounds entirely.\n\nPROOF STRATEGY: We work on the Skorokhod coupling space where mu_eps and mu coexist. The key idea is to express the regularized identity E_{mu_eps}[G(phi+psi)] = E_{mu_eps}[G(phi) R_eps(phi)] as a ratio of expectations involving exp(Psi_eps^{ren}), and show that the numerator and denominator converge separately using Vitali's theorem (exploiting the exponential integrability of Wick powers, nodes 1.6.2.10.2.4 and 1.6.2.10.3).\n\nThe proof is decomposed into children 1.6.3.1 through 1.6.3.4.\n\nDEPENDENCIES: Node 1.5.3 (L^p convergence of Psi^{ren}); Node 1.5.4 (sub-Gaussian tails of L_eps, L^p divergence for p\u003e1); Node 1.5.2 (normalization K_eps = -log E_{mu_eps}[exp(Psi^{ren} + L_eps)]); Node 1.6.2.10.3 (exponential integrability under mu); Node 1.6.2.10.2.4 (uniform exponential bounds under mu_eps); Node 1.6.2.5 (k=1 sub-Gaussian); Node 1.2 (setup).\n\nREFERENCES: Scheffe (1947); Vitali convergence theorem; Skorokhod representation theorem (Billingsley, Convergence of Probability Measures, Theorem 6.7); Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"c2b614095e37e1b9504bae77fe609fc3708b64ef05512f3a1026bf1e2a5ebe70","created":"2026-02-08T22:04:56.62294926Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
