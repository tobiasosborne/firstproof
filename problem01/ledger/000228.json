However, Method 1 is a NEGATIVE result (showing that moment summation fails for k \u003e= 2), and Method 3 (the actual proof argument) is entirely self-contained — it does not use any output of 1.6.2.10.1. Since 1.6.2.10.1 has been challenged for circular reasoning and unjustified mu_0-to-mu_eps transfer, the formal dependency should be removed. Method 3 does not logically depend on it.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
