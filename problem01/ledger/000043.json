Let C = C_eps(0) denote the covariance at coinciding points (the Wick constant). We suppress the subscript eps and write :·: for :·:_{C_eps} throughout.\n\nWe use the following Wick-ordering definitions for powers with respect to covariance C:\n\n  (W4)  :f^4: = f^4 - 6C f^2 + 3C^2\n  (W3)  :f^3: = f^3 - 3C f\n  (W2)  :f^2: = f^2 - C\n  (W1)  :f:   = f\n\nThese are the standard Hermite-type Wick polynomials. Note that g = psi_eps is deterministic, so Wick ordering acts only on the stochastic field f; g is treated as a parameter/coefficient.\n\n=== Claim ===\n\nWe prove the exact algebraic identity:\n\n  :(f - g)^4: - :f^4: = -4g :f^3: + 6g^2 :f^2: - 4g^3 f + g^4.\n\n=== Step 1: Expand :(f-g)^4: using definition (W4) ===\n\nBy (W4) applied to the argument (f - g):\n\n  :(f-g)^4: = (f-g)^4 - 6C(f-g)^2 + 3C^2.        ... (I)\n\nSimilarly, by (W4) applied to f:\n\n  :f^4: = f^4 - 6C f^2 + 3C^2.                      ... (II)\n\n=== Step 2: Compute the difference :(f-g)^4: - :f^4: ===\n\nSubtracting (II) from (I):\n\n  :(f-g)^4: - :f^4: = [(f-g)^4 - f^4] - 6C[(f-g)^2 - f^2] + [3C^2 - 3C^2].\n\nThe constant Wick terms 3C^2 cancel exactly:\n\n  :(f-g)^4: - :f^4: = [(f-g)^4 - f^4] - 6C[(f-g)^2 - f^2].    ... (III)\n\nThis is the first key cancellation: the divergent constant 3C^2 drops out of the difference.\n\n=== Step 3: Expand (f-g)^4 - f^4 ===\n\nBy the binomial theorem:\n\n  (f-g)^4 = f^4 - 4f^3 g + 6f^2 g^2 - 4f g^3 + g^4.\n\nTherefore:\n\n  (f-g)^4 - f^4 = -4f^3 g + 6f^2 g^2 - 4f g^3 + g^4.          ... (IV)\n\n=== Step 4: Expand (f-g)^2 - f^2 ===\n\nWe have:\n\n  (f-g)^2 = f^2 - 2fg + g^2.\n\nTherefore:\n\n  (f-g)^2 - f^2 = -2fg + g^2.                                    ... (V)\n\n=== Step 5: Substitute (IV) and (V) into (III) ===\n\n  :(f-g)^4: - :f^4:\n    = [-4f^3 g + 6f^2 g^2 - 4f g^3 + g^4] - 6C[-2fg + g^2]\n    = -4f^3 g + 6f^2 g^2 - 4f g^3 + g^4 + 12Cfg - 6Cg^2.\n\nRearranging by collecting terms with common powers of g:\n\n  = -4g(f^3 - 3Cf) + 6g^2(f^2 - C) - 4g^3 f + g^4.              ... (VI)\n\nLet us verify this rearrangement explicitly:\n\n  -4g(f^3 - 3Cf) = -4gf^3 + 12Cfg.                               [matches the f^3 and Cf terms]\n  6g^2(f^2 - C)  = 6g^2 f^2 - 6Cg^2.                             [matches the f^2 g^2 and Cg^2 terms]\n  -4g^3 f                                                          [matches]\n  +g^4                                                             [matches]\n\nSumming: -4gf^3 + 12Cfg + 6g^2 f^2 - 6Cg^2 - 4g^3 f + g^4, which equals line (VI). Confirmed.\n\n=== Step 6: Identify the Wick polynomials ===\n\nFrom definitions (W3) and (W2):\n\n  :f^3: = f^3 - 3Cf,    so    f^3 - 3Cf = :f^3:.\n  :f^2: = f^2 - C,       so    f^2 - C   = :f^2:.\n\nSubstituting into (VI):\n\n  :(f-g)^4: - :f^4: = -4g :f^3: + 6g^2 :f^2: - 4g^3 f + g^4.    ... (VII)\n\n=== Step 7: Verify the cancellation of the divergent Wick constant ===\n\nThe Wick constant C = C_eps(0) appears in three places in the intermediate computation:\n\n  (a) The constant +3C^2 from :(f-g)^4: and -3C^2 from :f^4:: these cancel in Step 2.\n  (b) The term -6C(f-g)^2 from :(f-g)^4: contributes +12Cfg - 6Cg^2 in Steps 4-5.\n  (c) The term +6Cf^2 from :f^4: contributes -6Cf^2 (absorbed in the f^4 - f^4 cancellation, but equivalently reappears when we group into Wick powers).\n\nMore precisely, the C-dependent contributions are:\n  From the quartic Wick term: +12Cfg (from expanding -6C(f-g)^2 vs +6Cf^2).\n  From the quadratic Wick term: -6Cg^2 (from expanding -6C(f-g)^2 vs +6Cf^2... wait, let us be fully explicit).\n\nLet us track all C-dependent terms directly. From (III):\n\n  -6C[(f-g)^2 - f^2] = -6C[-2fg + g^2] = +12Cfg - 6Cg^2.\n\nThese are the ONLY C-dependent terms in the entire expression. They are absorbed as follows:\n\n  +12Cfg is absorbed into -4g(f^3 - 3Cf) via the -4g(-3Cf) = +12Cfg term.\n  -6Cg^2 is absorbed into 6g^2(f^2 - C) via the 6g^2(-C) = -6Cg^2 term.\n\nAfter absorption into Wick polynomials :f^3: and :f^2:, NO explicit C remains in the final expression (VII). The remaining terms -4g^3 f + g^4 are C-independent (they involve only the deterministic function g and the bare field f, not the Wick constant). This confirms the claim that \"the divergent Wick constant C_eps(0) cancels between the quartic and quadratic contributions.\"\n\n=== Step 8: Restoring full notation ===\n\nSubstituting back f = phi_eps, g = psi_eps, C = C_eps(0), and :·: = :·:_{C_eps}:\n\n  :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^4:_{C_eps} - :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps}\n    = -4 psi_eps :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps} + 6 psi_eps^2 :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps}\n      - 4 psi_eps^3 phi_eps + psi_eps^4.\n\nThis is an exact algebraic identity, valid pointwise for every x in T^3 and every eps \u003e 0.\n\n=== Summary ===\n\nThe proof proceeds by:\n(1) Applying the Wick definition :h^4: = h^4 - 6Ch^2 + 3C^2 to both h = f-g and h = f;\n(2) Taking the difference, in which the constant 3C^2 cancels;\n(3) Expanding the remaining polynomial differences by the binomial theorem;\n(4) Grouping terms by powers of g = psi_eps and recognizing that the C-dependent pieces recombine exactly into the Wick polynomials :f^3: = f^3 - 3Cf and :f^2: = f^2 - C;\n(5) Confirming that no residual C-dependence remains outside these Wick monomials.\n\nThe identity is purely algebraic and requires no analytic estimates.
