Define the functional F_k: X -\u003e R by F_k(phi, :phi^2:, :phi^3:) = \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e := integral_{T^3} f(x) :phi^k:(x) dx. We show F_k is Lipschitz on the enhanced data space X, and then apply the BG concentration inequality (node 1.6.2.7) to conclude exponential integrability.\n\nStep 1 (Lipschitz property): F_k depends only on the k-th component of the enhanced data. By definition, F_k(phi, :phi^2:, :phi^3:) = \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e. This is a LINEAR functional of :phi^k: in C^{-k/2-delta}(T^3). Since f in C^inf(T^3) subset C^{k/2+delta}(T^3), the duality pairing \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e is bounded by |\u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e| \u003c= ||f||_{C^{k/2+delta}} * ||:phi^k:||_{C^{-k/2-delta}} (this uses the duality between C^s and C^{-s} Besov spaces, as established in the external reference 'Besov duality pairing'). Therefore F_k is Lipschitz with constant L_k = ||f||_{C^{k/2+delta}} with respect to the C^{-k/2-delta} norm on the k-th component, and hence also Lipschitz with constant L_k with respect to the product norm on X (since the product norm dominates each component norm).\n\nStep 2 (Sub-Gaussian concentration): By node 1.6.2.7 (BG concentration for enhanced data), since F_k is L_k-Lipschitz, we have P_mu(|F_k - M_{F_k}| \u003e t) \u003c= C exp(-c t^2 / L_k^2) for all t \u003e 0. This is a sub-Gaussian tail bound.\n\nStep 3 (Exponential moments): A sub-Gaussian random variable Y with P(|Y - m| \u003e t) \u003c= C exp(-c t^2) satisfies E[exp(alpha Y)] \u003c infinity for ALL alpha in R. Proof: E[exp(alpha Y)] = exp(alpha m) E[exp(alpha(Y-m))] and E[exp(alpha(Y-m))] = 1 + integral_0^infinity alpha exp(alpha t) P(Y-m \u003e t) dt + integral_0^infinity |alpha| exp(-alpha t) P(Y-m \u003c -t) dt, both integrals converge by the Gaussian decay of the tails. Concretely, E[exp(alpha(Y-m))] \u003c= exp(alpha^2/(4c)) (standard Chernoff bound for sub-Gaussians).\n\nConclusion: For k=2,3, E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e)] \u003c= exp(alpha M_{F_k} + alpha^2 L_k^2/(4c)) \u003c infinity for all alpha in R.\n\nCRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM REFUTED PROOF: This argument works entirely on the limiting measure mu and the limiting enhanced data (phi, :phi^2:, :phi^3:). There is NO regularization (no mu_eps), NO Wick-to-raw power decomposition (no divergent C_eps(0) terms), NO Fatou's lemma across changing measures, and NO term-by-term bounding that destroys Wick cancellations. The entire argument is: (1) Wick powers are well-defined in Besov spaces (node 1.6.1, validated), (2) smeared Wick powers are Lipschitz functionals of the enhanced data, (3) Lipschitz functionals of the Phi^4_3 enhanced data have sub-Gaussian tails (BG concentration), (4) sub-Gaussian tails imply all exponential moments.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"69e24e259d0ba0ea4cff2fe0f780cc869882757a33468ccc963a7e9c6d6ffc40","created":"2026-02-08T20:00:46.028798869Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
