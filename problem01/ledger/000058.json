{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-08T18:26:03.208677108Z","node_id":"1.4.3","note":"VERIFIED. All checks passed. (1) Starting point V_eps definition matches node 1.2. (2) Linearity of mollification correct. (3) Substitution from validated nodes 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 correctly transcribed. (4) All 6 signs verified by independent recomputation. (5) Degree classification correct for all 6 terms. (6) Completeness: 4+2=6 terms, regrouped as 1+1+2+2=6, no omissions or duplications. (7) Consistent with parent node 1.4. MINOR NOTES: inference type should be derivation not assumption; no formal dependencies on 1.4.1/1.4.2 declared. Proof is purely algebraic, holds pointwise for every eps \u003e 0."}
