The proof itself demonstrates (lines 860-864) that for any FIXED p \u003e 1, the L^p(mu_eps) norm of R_eps diverges as eps -\u003e 0 because the sub-Gaussian contribution sigma^2 p^2 beta_eps^2 grows as (log 1/eps)^2. The proof then ASSERTS uniform integrability without providing either: (a) a de la Vallee-Poussin function G with sup_eps E[G(|R_eps|)] \u003c infinity, (b) an explicit uniform L^p bound for any fixed p \u003e 1, or (c) any other concrete criterion. The statement 'The uniform integrability follows from the sub-Gaussian control of the linear tilt combined with the L^p convergence of the Wick-power part' is not a proof -- it is a vague gesture at an argument that the proof itself showed cannot work via L^p bounds with fixed p. This is a critical gap because the entire node's claim (iii) rests on this uniform integrability, and without it, the L^1 convergence of R_eps to a valid Radon-Nikodym derivative is not established by this node.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
