The proof claims this 'has finite exponential moments by the k=1 case' but this is incorrect: the k=1 sub-Gaussian bound gives E_{mu_eps}[exp(beta \u003cf, phi_eps\u003e)] \u003c= exp(C beta^2), so for beta = 3 alpha C_eps(0) the bound is exp(C alpha^2 C_eps(0)^2) ~ exp(C/eps^2), which diverges. The proof attempts to handle the Wick correction as a separate term bounded by the k=1 result, but the correction coefficient DIVERGES. The correct approach must treat \u003cf, :phi_eps^3:\u003e = int f phi_eps^3 dx - 3 C_eps(0) int f phi_eps dx as a single object whose distribution converges (even though individual pieces diverge). Decomposing into divergent pieces and bounding separately is fundamentally invalid here.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
