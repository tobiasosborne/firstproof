In the Boue-Dupuis formula, the drift h = I_u = int_0^1 u_s ds where u is an ADAPTED process, meaning h depends on the Brownian motion X. The node calls h 'the deterministic drift part' and claims that taking expectations kills all cross-terms: E[:X_eps^j:_{C_eps} h_eps^{n-j}] = 0 for j \u003e= 1. This is FALSE for adapted drifts. When h = I_u depends on X, the Wick power :X_eps^j: and the function h_eps^{n-j}(I_u) are CORRELATED, so their expectation is not the product of expectations. The identity E[V_eps^{(alpha)}(X + I_u)] = lambda int h_eps^4 dx + delta_m_eps^2 int h_eps^2 dx - alpha int f h_eps^k dx holds ONLY for deterministic h. For adapted drifts, additional cross-terms contribute. This error invalidates Steps 3.1-3.2, and since Step 3.3 operates on the (incorrectly derived) deterministic functional F(h), the entire chain 3.1-\u003e3.2-\u003e3.3 is unsound. The BG (2020) argument correctly handles adapted drifts through the Polchinski flow, but this node does not provide that argument — it presents Steps 3.1-3.2 as rigorous proof steps rather than heuristic.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
