By the Besov duality external reference (Triebel 1983), the pairing is continuous when alpha + beta \u003e 0, where f in C^alpha and g in C^{-beta}, giving alpha - beta \u003e 0 as the condition. Here alpha = k/2+delta and beta = k/2+delta, giving alpha - beta = 0. This is the SAME borderline issue flagged in the original node 1.6.1 verification. The correct bound requires f in C^{k/2+delta'} with delta' \u003e delta, i.e., the Lipschitz constant should be ||f||_{C^{k/2+2delta}} (or C^{k/2+delta'} for any delta' \u003e delta). Since f in C^inf, both norms are finite and the final CONCLUSION (finiteness of exponential moments for each fixed f) is unaffected. However, the stated Lipschitz constant ||f||_{C^{k/2+delta}} is incorrect, and this matters if one ever needs to track the dependence of the exponential moment bound on f (e.g., for uniformity over a class of test functions).","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
