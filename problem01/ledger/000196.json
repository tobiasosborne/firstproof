(2) For k=2, E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi^2:\u003e)] \u003c infinity for all alpha in R by Lipschitz concentration of the enhanced data (nodes 1.6.2.6, 1.6.2.7, 1.6.2.8). (3) For k=3, E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi^3:\u003e)] \u003c infinity for all alpha in R by the same Lipschitz concentration argument (nodes 1.6.2.6, 1.6.2.7, 1.6.2.8). This establishes the full claim of node 1.6.2: for all smooth f and all k=1,2,3, the smeared Wick powers \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e have finite exponential moments of all orders under the Phi^4_3 measure mu. The proof relies on: (a) the validated node 1.6.1 for well-definedness of Wick powers in Besov spaces, (b) the Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020) variational construction and its concentration consequences, and (c) standard sub-Gaussian moment bounds. No UV regularization or passage through mu_eps is needed.
