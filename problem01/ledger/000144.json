(ii) :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps} = phi_eps^3 - 3 C_eps(0) phi_eps converges mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1 to a limit :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-delta}(T^3) for every delta \u003e 0. The regularity indices -1-delta and -3/2-delta are sharp up to the delta loss. Proof: For (i), the Besov regularity of :phi^2: follows from the product structure. Since phi in C^{-1/2-delta}, by the paraproduct decomposition of Bony (1981) and the refinement in Gubinelli-Imkeller-Perkowski (2015, Theorem 4.1), the resonant product phi \\\\circ phi is well-defined provided the sum of regularities exceeds -d = -3, which is satisfied since (-1/2-delta) + (-1/2-delta) = -1-2delta \u003e -3. The Wick subtraction removes the divergent diagonal and the limit :phi^2: belongs to C^{2(-1/2-delta)} = C^{-1-2delta}. Since delta \u003e 0 is arbitrary, we may relabel to get C^{-1-delta} for any delta \u003e 0. For (ii), :phi^3: = :phi^2: \\\\cdot phi (via the recursive Wick product formula) requires the paracontrolled analysis. The enhanced data (phi, :phi^2:, :phi^3:) is part of the model/modelled distribution in Hairer's framework. In regularity structures (Hairer 2014, Section 10), the symbol Xi^3 has homogeneity 3(-1/2-delta) = -3/2-3delta, and the reconstruction theorem (Theorem 3.10) yields :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-3delta} subset C^{-3/2-delta}. In paracontrolled distributions (GIP 2015, Section 5.2), the iterated commutator estimates give the same regularity. The L^p(mu) convergence for all p \u003e= 1 follows from the uniform moment bounds E_mu[||:phi_eps^k:||_{C^{-k/2-delta}}^p] \u003c= C(p) \u003c infinity established in Mourrat-Weber (2017, Proposition 3.2) and Gubinelli-Hofmanova (2019, Proposition 2.3).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"68e4ca544c88e9034596e556a589c1914a65e3e7c8d0cdd52ce5adfcf983c9ac","created":"2026-02-08T19:33:31.069872961Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
