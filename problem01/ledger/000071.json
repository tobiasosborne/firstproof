Strict positivity: since exp(-V_eps(phi)) \u003e 0 for mu_0-a.e. phi (node 1.2.2), the integral of a mu_0-a.e. strictly positive measurable function against a probability measure is strictly positive. Finiteness: the Wick-ordered quartic satisfies :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps} = phi_eps^4 - 6 C_eps(0) phi_eps^2 + 3 C_eps(0)^2 where C_eps(0) = integral |rho_hat(eps k)|^2 / (|k|^2 + m^2) dk/(2pi)^3 is finite for eps \u003e 0. Since lambda \u003e 0, the leading quartic term ensures V_eps(phi) \u003e= lambda integral phi_eps^4 dx - C_1(eps) integral phi_eps^2 dx - C_2(eps) for deterministic constants C_1(eps), C_2(eps) depending on eps, lambda, and delta_m_eps^2. By the Fernique theorem, phi_eps (being a Gaussian random variable in C^inf(T^3)) has Gaussian tails in all L^p norms; in particular E_{mu_0}[exp(alpha integral phi_eps^2 dx)] \u003c infinity for all alpha \u003e 0. Therefore exp(-V_eps) \u003c= exp(C_1(eps) integral phi_eps^2 dx + C_2(eps)) lies in L^1(mu_0), proving Z_eps \u003c infinity.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"86813fd864f14a34c439a490ad874c83357d61fcf592f9a73f550f6a472b1644","created":"2026-02-08T18:38:19.896687448Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
