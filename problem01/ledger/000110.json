The term ((-Delta+m^2)psi, phi) involves phi (not phi_eps) because it arises from the Cameron-Martin shift contribution in Node 1.3, which acts on the abstract Wiener space level and pairs the H^1-gradient of the shift with the field directly. This is confirmed in the validated proof of Node 1.5.1, Step 2, item (v), where this term is identified as having \"no eps-dependent divergent prefactor\" and involving \"(-Delta+m^2)psi ... a fixed distribution tested against phi.\"\n\nFrom Node 1.4.4 (VALIDATED): The convergence of each eps-dependent term is established:\n  (a) T1_eps -\u003e T1 := 4 lambda integral psi :phi^3: dx, mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.\n  (b) T2_eps -\u003e T2 := -6 lambda integral psi^2 :phi^2: dx, mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.\n  (c.i) T3_eps -\u003e T3 := 4 lambda (psi^3, phi), mu-a.s. (and in L^p(mu) by dominated convergence, see below).\n\n=== Step 1: Term-by-term convergence ===\n\nWe verify that each of the four terms in (*) converges individually as eps -\u003e 0:\n\nTerm 1 (T1_eps): By Node 1.4.4(a), the duality pairing (psi_eps, :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps}) converges to (psi, :phi^3:) as eps -\u003e 0. The proof in 1.4.4(a) uses: (i) :phi_eps^3:_{C_eps} -\u003e :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-delta}(T^3), mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu), from the regularity structures theory; (ii) psi_eps -\u003e psi in C^{3/2+2delta}(T^3); (iii) continuity of the duality pairing C^{3/2+2delta} x C^{-3/2-delta} -\u003e R. The convergence holds mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.\n\nConclusion: T1_eps -\u003e T1 = 4 lambda integral psi :phi^3: dx, mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu).\n\nTerm 2 (T2_eps): By Node 1.4.4(b), the duality pairing (psi_eps^2, :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps}) converges to (psi^2, :phi^2:) as eps -\u003e 0. The proof uses: (i) :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} -\u003e :phi^2: in C^{-1-delta}(T^3); (ii) psi_eps^2 -\u003e psi^2 in C^{1+2delta}(T^3); (iii) continuity of C^{1+2delta} x C^{-1-delta} -\u003e R.\n\nConclusion: T2_eps -\u003e T2 = -6 lambda integral psi^2 :phi^2: dx, mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu).\n\nTerm 3 (T3_eps): By Node 1.4.4(c.i), the pairing (psi_eps^3, phi_eps) converges to (psi^3, phi) as eps -\u003e 0. The proof uses: (i) phi_eps -\u003e phi in C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3); (ii) psi_eps^3 -\u003e psi^3 in C^{1/2+2delta}(T^3); (iii) continuity of C^{1/2+2delta} x C^{-1/2-delta} -\u003e R. The convergence holds mu-a.s.\n\nWe strengthen from mu-a.s. to L^p(mu) convergence: Since |(psi_eps^3, phi_eps)| \u003c= C ||psi^3||_{C^{1/2+2delta}} ||phi_eps||_{C^{-1/2-delta}} \u003c= C' ||phi||_{C^{-1/2-delta}} (the latter holding for all eps small enough, since mollification is an L^1-contraction on Besov-Hoelder spaces), we have |T3_eps| \u003c= C'' ||phi||_{C^{-1/2-delta}} for a fixed constant C'' independent of eps. Under the Phi^4_3 measure mu, ||phi||_{C^{-1/2-delta}} is in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1. This follows from the sub-Gaussian tail estimates of Barashkov-Gubinelli (2021), which give E_mu[exp(c ||phi||_{C^{-1/2-delta}}^2)] \u003c infinity, implying all polynomial moments are finite. By the dominated convergence theorem in L^p(mu), T3_eps -\u003e T3 in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.\n\nConclusion: T3_eps -\u003e T3 = 4 lambda (psi^3, phi), mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu).\n\nTerm 4 (T4): The term T4 = ((-Delta+m^2)psi, phi) has NO eps dependence whatsoever. It is a fixed random variable for each realization of phi. No convergence argument is needed for this term; it is already in its limiting form.\n\nMoreover, T4 is well-defined under mu: (-Delta+m^2)psi is in C^inf(T^3) (since psi is smooth and (-Delta+m^2) maps smooth functions to smooth functions on T^3), and phi in C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) mu-a.s. The duality pairing C^{1/2+2delta} x C^{-1/2-delta} -\u003e R is continuous, and since C^inf embeds into C^{1/2+2delta}, the pairing ((-Delta+m^2)psi, phi) is well-defined and finite. The bound |T4| = |((-Delta+m^2)psi, phi)| \u003c= C ||(-Delta+m^2)psi||_{C^{1/2+2delta}} ||phi||_{C^{-1/2-delta}} shows T4 is in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1 (by the same integrability of ||phi||_{C^{-1/2-delta}} cited above).\n\nConclusion: T4 = ((-Delta+m^2)psi, phi) is eps-independent, well-defined, and in L^p(mu).\n\n=== Step 2: Convergence of the sum ===\n\nBy definition (*), Psi_eps^{ren}(phi) = T1_eps + T2_eps + T3_eps + T4. We define the limiting sum as\n\n  Psi^{ren}(phi) = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4\n                 = 4 lambda integral psi :phi^3: dx - 6 lambda integral psi^2 :phi^2: dx + 4 lambda (psi^3, phi) + ((-Delta+m^2)psi, phi).\n\nSince this is a FINITE sum of four terms, and each term converges individually (T1_eps -\u003e T1, T2_eps -\u003e T2, T3_eps -\u003e T3, T4 = T4 = const in eps), the sum converges to the sum of the limits:\n\n  Psi_eps^{ren}(phi) = T1_eps + T2_eps + T3_eps + T4\n                     -\u003e T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 = Psi^{ren}(phi).\n\nConvergence mode: Since each of T1_eps, T2_eps, T3_eps converges in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1, and T4 is constant in eps (hence trivially convergent in any mode), the sum Psi_eps^{ren} converges in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1. This is because a finite sum of L^p-convergent sequences converges in L^p (by the triangle inequality: ||Sum_i (X_i^eps - X_i)||_p \u003c= Sum_i ||X_i^eps - X_i||_p -\u003e 0). A fortiori, Psi_eps^{ren} converges in probability under mu (since L^p convergence implies convergence in probability for p \u003e= 1, by Chebyshev/Markov inequality).\n\n=== Step 3: Well-definedness of the limit ===\n\nWe must show Psi^{ren}(phi) is a well-defined random variable under mu. This amounts to showing each summand is well-defined and measurable, and that the sum is mu-a.s. finite.\n\n(i) T1 = 4 lambda (psi, :phi^3:): Well-defined mu-a.s. because :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-delta}(T^3) mu-a.s. (regularity structures theory) and psi in C^inf subset C^{3/2+2delta}(T^3), so the duality pairing is well-defined and finite. In L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1 (by the L^p convergence established in 1.4.4(a) and the completeness of L^p).\n\n(ii) T2 = -6 lambda (psi^2, :phi^2:): Well-defined mu-a.s. because :phi^2: in C^{-1-delta}(T^3) mu-a.s. and psi^2 in C^inf subset C^{1+2delta}. In L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.\n\n(iii) T3 = 4 lambda (psi^3, phi): Well-defined mu-a.s. because phi in C^{-1/2-delta} and psi^3 in C^inf subset C^{1/2+2delta}. In L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.\n\n(iv) T4 = ((-Delta+m^2)psi, phi): Well-defined mu-a.s. by the same argument as T3 (with (-Delta+m^2)psi in place of psi^3; both are smooth). In L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.\n\nSince each summand is in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1, the sum Psi^{ren}(phi) = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 is also in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1 (by the Minkowski inequality). In particular, Psi^{ren}(phi) is a well-defined, mu-a.s. finite random variable.\n\n=== Conclusion ===\n\nAs eps -\u003e 0:\n\n  Psi_eps^{ren}(phi) -\u003e Psi^{ren}(phi) = 4 lambda integral psi :phi^3: dx - 6 lambda integral psi^2 :phi^2: dx + 4 lambda (psi^3, phi) + ((-Delta+m^2)psi, phi),\n\nwith convergence in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1 (and hence in probability under mu). The limit Psi^{ren}(phi) is a well-defined random variable in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.\n\nThe convergence holds because:\n  (1) The Wick powers :phi_eps^k:_{C_eps} converge to :phi^k: in the appropriate Besov-Hoelder spaces (regularity structures / paracontrolled theory);\n  (2) The smooth test functions psi, psi^2, psi^3 and their mollified versions provide sufficient positive regularity for well-defined duality pairings;\n  (3) The continuity of the duality pairing C^alpha x C^{-beta} -\u003e R for alpha \u003e beta ensures that convergence of each factor implies convergence of each pairing;\n  (4) The fourth term ((-Delta+m^2)psi, phi) is eps-independent, requiring no limiting argument;\n  (5) The finite sum of L^p-convergent terms converges in L^p.\n\nThis is precisely the statement of Node 1.5.3.
