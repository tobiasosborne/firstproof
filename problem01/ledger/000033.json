Under mu_eps (and in the limit mu), the linear functional \u003cpsi, phi\u003e has sub-Gaussian tails with constants uniform in eps. Therefore E_{mu_eps}[exp(L_eps)] = E_{mu_eps}[exp(2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi, phi\u003e)] is finite for each eps (though growing). The normalization constant -log E_{mu_eps}[exp(Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps)] absorbs this growth. The key point: the normalized quantity R_eps is a ratio that remains bounded in L^p(mu) for suitable p, even as individual terms diverge.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"787370ce4e166db00168955e5ed46e459dc3c54af40ec454774b941edaf0c8f1","created":"2026-02-08T14:40:41.436902704Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
