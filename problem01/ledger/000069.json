For mu_0-a.e. phi, the mollified field phi_eps = rho_eps * phi is a smooth function on T^3 (since rho_eps is smooth with compact support in Fourier space and phi is a distribution, the convolution phi_eps lies in C^inf(T^3) by standard regularization theory). Therefore the Wick-ordered monomials :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps}(x) and :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps}(x) are well-defined continuous functions of x in T^3 for each realization of phi. Since T^3 is compact, the integrals integral_{T^3} :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps} dx and integral_{T^3} :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} dx are finite real numbers. Hence V_eps(phi) = lambda integral :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps} dx + delta_m_eps^2 integral :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} dx is a finite real number for mu_0-a.e. phi.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"b16232549a10674a3364ca7e2b5f7160e6bbbad0814f92b94321a403fd014e72","created":"2026-02-08T18:38:19.896680748Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
