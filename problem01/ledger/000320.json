PROOF: By node 1.6.4.3 (Step 1), mu_eps^L = (Z_eps^L)^{-1} exp(-V_eps^L) dmu_0 where V_eps^L = lambda int :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps} dx + delta_m_eps^2 int :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} dx. The potential V_eps^L has the SAME structure as V_eps: (i) The quartic part lambda int :phi_eps^4: dx is identical. (ii) The quadratic part delta_m_eps^2 int :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2: dx \u003e= 0 (since (phi_eps - psi_eps)^2 \u003e= 0, so :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2: \u003e= -C_eps(0)). In particular, V_eps^L \u003e= lambda int :phi_eps^4: dx - delta_m_eps^2 C_eps(0)|T^3|. The QUARTIC DOMINATION argument (node 1.6.2.10.2.4) for the bound E_{mu_eps}[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e)] \u003c= M works as follows: (1) Use the Boue-Dupuis variational formula to write -log Z_eps and E_{mu_eps}[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e)] as variational problems. (2) Apply Young inequality: alpha \u003cf, :phi^k:\u003e \u003c= (k/4) V_eps + C(alpha, f, k) (quartic domination since k \u003c= 3 \u003c 4). (3) The resulting integral is bounded by a factor depending on Z_eps and the Gaussian partition function. Steps (1)-(3) depend on V_eps ONLY through its quartic coercivity: V_eps \u003e= lambda int :phi_eps^4: dx - C (for some constant C independent of eps). Since V_eps^L satisfies the SAME coercivity bound V_eps^L \u003e= lambda int :phi_eps^4: dx - C (with possibly a different constant C depending on psi), the IDENTICAL argument gives: E_{mu_eps^L}[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps^k:\u003e)] \u003c= M_L(alpha, f, k) with M_L depending on the quartic coupling lambda and the coercivity constant, but uniform in eps. The key point is that the Boue-Dupuis + Young inequality argument is insensitive to the precise form of the quadratic part of the potential -- it uses only the quartic coercivity and the structure of the Gaussian reference measure mu_0. CONSEQUENCE: The uniform integrability of exp(Psi_eps^{ren}) under mu_eps^L (needed in node 1.6.4.4 Step 3(b)) follows by the same Holder + Vitali argument as in node 1.6.3.4: sup_eps E_{mu_eps^L}[exp((1+delta) Psi_eps^{ren})] \u003c= prod_{j=1}^4 M_L(4(1+delta) c_j, f_j, k_j)^{1/4} \u003c infinity.
