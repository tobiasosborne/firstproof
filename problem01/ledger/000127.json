Node 1.5.4 contains one sound component and two critical failures.\n\nPART I (Sub-Gaussian tails, uniform in eps): CORRECT. The Brascamp-Lieb argument, after absorbing the concave mass counterterm into the Gaussian reference measure, is valid. The modified Gaussian mu_0^W has INCREASED inverse covariance (since 6 lambda C_eps(0) - delta_m^2 \u003e 0 adds a positive term), so C_W \u003c= C componentwise. The convex quartic then further concentrates the measure. The tilting argument for the full MGF bound Lambda_eps(alpha) \u003c= sigma^2 alpha^2/2 via Lambda''(alpha) \u003c= sigma^2 for all alpha is correct. The constant sigma^2 = ||psi||^2_{H^{-1}} is independent of eps as claimed.\n\nPART II (Finiteness of MGF for each eps): CORRECT. This is a direct substitution into the sub-Gaussian bound. The quantitative growth rate exp(C(log 1/eps)^2) is correctly computed.\n\nPART III (L^p boundedness of R_eps): CONTAINS CRITICAL ERRORS.\n\n(A) The original claim (R_eps bounded in L^p for suitable p, uniformly in eps) is FALSE by the proof's own analysis. The proof shows (Factor1 bound) that E[R_eps^p] \u003e= exp(sigma^2(p^2-1)beta_eps^2/2) with beta_eps ~ log(1/eps) -\u003e infinity, so for any fixed p \u003e 1, the L^p norm diverges. The proof acknowledges this (lines 860-864) but then claims uniform integrability without proof.\n\n(B) The uniform integrability claim (lines 882-883) is ASSERTED without proof. The phrase 'follows from the sub-Gaussian control combined with L^p convergence of Psi_eps^{ren}' is not an argument. The proof does not produce a de la Vallee-Poussin function, does not produce a fixed L^p bound, and the seven attempted approaches (Steps III.1-III.7) all fail to establish what is needed.\n\n(C) The proof relies on unvalidated Node 1.6.2 (exponential integrability of Wick powers) for the exp(alpha |Psi_eps^{ren}|) integrability, creating an undeclared dependency on an unverified result.\n\nVERDICT: Parts I and II are mathematically sound and should be preserved. Part III must be rewritten. The node statement must be corrected to reflect what is actually proven. The prover should either: (1) produce a genuine uniform integrability argument (possibly via entropy bounds or the Barashkov-Gubinelli Girsanov framework directly), or (2) restructure the proof to avoid the need for uniform L^p bounds of the regularized RN derivatives, or (3) explicitly delegate the uniform integrability to a separate node with proper dependencies.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"986475d02a1794d3db6e50e76cc2f6986e1a8996bd8bbed150c1dafd7c766537","created":"2026-02-08T19:17:44.558366069Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
