This is NOT a stochastic integral (in the Ito or Stratonovich sense). It is an ordinary Bochner integral of an adapted process. The randomness comes from the adaptedness of u_s to the filtration generated by the Brownian motion, not from stochastic integration. The distinction matters conceptually: stochastic integrals are martingales, while I_u = int_0^1 u_s ds is not in general a martingale. This does not affect the mathematical argument.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
