Let rho_eps be a standard mollifier and phi_eps = rho_eps * phi. The UV-regularized Phi^4_3 measure is mu_eps = Z_eps^{-1} exp(-V_eps(phi)) dmu_0(phi) where V_eps(phi) = lambda integral :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps} dx + delta_m_eps^2 integral :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} dx with mass counterterm delta_m_eps^2 ~ c lambda^2 log(1/eps). For each eps \u003e 0, mu_eps is absolutely continuous w.r.t. mu_0 with strictly positive density, so mu_eps ~ mu_0. By Cameron-Martin (psi in C^inf subset H^1), we also have T_psi* mu_0 ~ mu_0. Therefore T_psi* mu_eps ~ mu_eps for each eps \u003e 0.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"09f49ffefdfdd1733b156a85a5fbc489e59a8688f6b7b6f83b5b7628c5b3d63c","created":"2026-02-08T14:39:50.077887632Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
