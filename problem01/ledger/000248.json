This is incorrect. Standard power counting in d=3 gives the engineering dimension of the coupling for int phi^3 dx as d - 3(d-2)/2 = 3 - 3/2 = 3/2 \u003e 0, which means the cubic interaction is RELEVANT (positive engineering dimension), not irrelevant. The claim that 'the integrated cubic has negative effective dimension' is false.\n\nThe citation 'BG 2020, Section 4, Proposition 4.1' is misleading: that proposition controls the flow of the quartic coupling and establishes bounds on the effective potential. It does NOT assert that cubic perturbations are irrelevant -- and indeed they are NOT irrelevant by power counting.\n\nThe CORRECT justification for why the cubic term does not obstruct the analysis is NOT RG irrelevance but rather QUARTIC DOMINATION: for any bounded coefficient g_3(x) = -alpha f(x), the pointwise Young inequality gives lambda t^4 + g_3(x) t^3 \u003e= lambda t^4 - |alpha| ||f||_infty |t|^3 \u003e= (lambda/4) t^4 - C(alpha, f, lambda) for all t in R. This ensures V_eps^{(alpha)} is bounded below up to eps-independent constants. This is a simple calculus fact (quartic growth dominates cubic), not an RG flow statement.\n\nThe error matters because (a) it demonstrates a misunderstanding of the RG classification that could lead to incorrect reasoning in other parts of the proof, and (b) the correct justification (Young's inequality) needs to be stated explicitly to make the argument self-contained.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
