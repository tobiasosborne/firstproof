Node 1.6.2.10.2 then proceeds via quartic domination (Method 3), which is a completely independent argument that does not use this node's output. The rest of the proof chain (1.6.2.10.3, 1.6.2.10.4) also does not rely on the specific p^{k/2} bound. This node appears to be a vestigial step from an earlier proof strategy. If the circularity and measure-transfer issues are not resolved, consider whether this node can simply be removed from the dependency chain without affecting the overall proof.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
