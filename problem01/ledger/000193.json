This enhanced data is essential: while :phi^k: cannot be recovered from phi alone (since phi is only a distribution), the Wick powers are bona fide random variables in the stated Besov spaces under mu. This is established in node 1.6.1 (VALIDATED). The key structural point is that the Phi^4_3 measure mu is defined on the ENHANCED data space X, not merely on distributions phi. All concentration inequalities for mu therefore apply to functionals of the full enhanced data (phi, :phi^2:, :phi^3:).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"56e281e220f522a75a477ec1d5bd26f4364814c70eadf9ee1c4bc1534cbe134c","created":"2026-02-08T20:00:46.028786581Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
