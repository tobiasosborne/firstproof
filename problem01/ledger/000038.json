This follows from: (a) For each eps, R_eps = exp(Psi_eps) with E_{mu_eps}[R_eps] = 1. (b) The exponent Psi_eps = Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps + K_eps has the property that Psi_eps^{ren} converges in L^p(mu) for p \u003e= 1 (by exponential integrability of Wick powers). (c) The divergent parts L_eps + K_eps together form a normalized exponential tilt: exp(L_eps + K_eps) has E_{mu_eps}[exp(Psi_eps^{ren}) exp(L_eps + K_eps)] = 1, so {R_eps} is an L^1-bounded martingale-like family. (d) By de la Vallee-Poussin criterion, uniform integrability follows from the L^p bound E_{mu_eps}[R_eps^p] \u003c= C_p for some p \u003e 1, which holds by Holder inequality using the exponential integrability of Psi_eps^{ren}.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"05a055435a0dba5f1fc2db5b62ee1ff99366594288ce8f938326b5f1491e7634","created":"2026-02-08T14:41:03.33189752Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
