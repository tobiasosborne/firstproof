By the Skorokhod representation theorem (Billingsley, Convergence of Probability Measures, Theorem 6.7), there exist a probability space (Omega, F, P) and X-valued random variables Phi_eps, Phi on Omega with law(Phi_eps) = mu_eps, law(Phi) = mu, and Phi_eps -\u003e Phi P-a.s. in X. This is the same coupling as in node 1.6.2.10.3 (validated). In particular, for every f in C^inf(T^3) and k in {1,2,3}, the duality pairing \u003cf, :phi_eps^k:\u003e is a continuous functional on X (by the Besov duality pairing C^{k/2+2delta} x C^{-k/2-delta} -\u003e R, with strict regularity gap k/2+2delta \u003e k/2+delta, cf. node 1.6.1 validated), so \u003cf, :Phi_eps^k:\u003e -\u003e \u003cf, :Phi^k:\u003e P-a.s. CONSEQUENCE FOR Psi^{ren}: The renormalized exponent Psi_eps^{ren}(phi) = 4 lambda int psi :phi^3: dx - 6 lambda int psi^2 :phi^2: dx + 4 lambda \u003cpsi^3, phi\u003e + \u003c(-Delta+m^2)psi, phi\u003e (node 1.5.1) is a finite sum of continuous functionals of the enhanced data. Therefore Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps) -\u003e Psi^{ren}(Phi) P-a.s. Since exp is continuous, exp(Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps)) -\u003e exp(Psi^{ren}(Phi)) P-a.s.
