The linear functional phi -\u003e \u003cf, phi\u003e is well-defined under mu since f in H^1(T^3) and the Phi^4_3 field phi in H^{-1+delta}(T^3) mu-a.s. By Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020, arXiv:1805.10814, Theorem 1.1), the Phi^4_3 measure mu on T^3 is constructed via the Boue-Dupuis variational formula, which yields sub-Gaussian tail estimates for linear functionals: for every f in H^1(T^3), there exists C_f \u003e 0 (depending on ||f||_{H^1}) such that P_mu(|\u003cf,phi\u003e| \u003e t) \u003c= 2 exp(-t^2/(2 C_f)) for all t \u003e 0. Equivalently, E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf,phi\u003e)] \u003c= exp(C_f alpha^2 / 2) \u003c infinity for all alpha in R. This is a direct consequence of the BG variational representation: the Phi^4_3 measure is expressed as the law of phi = X + integral_0^1 u_s ds where X is the GFF and u is an adapted drift solving a variational problem, and the resulting field inherits sub-Gaussian concentration from the underlying Gaussian structure. Note: The relevant external reference is 'Barashkov-Gubinelli variational' (2020) for the torus. The 2021 infinite-volume paper (arXiv:2112.05562) extends this to R^3 but is not needed here.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"c90efaac62df158410b2f97fc1821915acdee50c41542906cd9dac416fd3cd0e","created":"2026-02-08T20:00:46.028761022Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
