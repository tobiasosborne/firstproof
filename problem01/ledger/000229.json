Three potential repair paths:\n\n(1) DIRECT L^1 COMPARISON: Instead of controlling the Besov norm of :phi_eps^k: by V_eps^{k/4} pointwise (which requires supremum-to-integral control), control the DUALITY PAIRING \u003cf, :phi_eps^k:\u003e directly by V_eps^{k/4}. Since f is smooth (C^infinity on the compact torus T^3), the smearing by f replaces the Besov supremum norm with a spatially integrated quantity: \u003cf, :phi_eps^k:\u003e = int f(x) :phi_eps^k:(x) dx. By Holder in the spatial variable: |\u003cf, :phi_eps^k:\u003e| \u003c= ||f||_{L^{4/(4-k)}} * ||:phi_eps^k:||_{L^{4/k}}. If ||:phi_eps^k:||_{L^{4/k}} can be controlled by V_eps^{k/4} (which is an integral-to-integral comparison, more plausible than supremum-to-integral), then Young's inequality still yields the domination. But this requires relating L^{4/k} norms of Wick powers to the potential — which still faces the Wick decomposition issue (pitfall #2).\n\n(2) VARIATIONAL / BOSE-DUPUIS: Use the Boue-Dupuis variational formula (as in Barashkov-Gubinelli 2020) to bound E_{mu_0}[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps^k:\u003e - V_eps)] directly via the variational representation. This avoids pointwise bounds on individual configurations and works at the level of the infimum over adapted drifts.\n\n(3) LATTICE APPROXIMATION: On a finite lattice, all fields are finite-dimensional and Wick powers are ordinary polynomials. The quartic domination is elementary in finite dimensions (Young's inequality for real numbers). Transfer to the continuum via the standard lattice-to-continuum limit with uniform bounds.","severity":"note","raised_by":""}
