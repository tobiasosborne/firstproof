The exponential tilt L_eps = 2*delta_m_eps^2 * \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e has coefficient delta_m_eps^2 ~ C*log(1/eps) -\u003e infinity. Under mu_eps^L, the mean of \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e diverges: E_{mu_eps^L}[\u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e] \u003e= c * delta_m_eps^2 -\u003e infinity (by convexity of the cumulant generating function and the positive variance of \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e under mu_eps). Since psi is smooth and nonzero, ||phi||_{C^{-1/2-delta}} \u003e= c' |\u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e| / ||psi||_{B^{1/2+delta}_{1,1}}, so E_{mu_eps^L}[||phi||_{C^{-1/2-delta}}] -\u003e infinity. This is incompatible with tightness of {mu_eps^L} in C^{-1/2-delta}. The quartic domination that gives tightness of {mu_eps} FAILS for mu_eps^L because the divergent linear tilt overwhelms quartic confinement in the psi direction (the effective mean shifts as (log 1/eps)^{1/3} due to competition between quartic confinement and linear tilt).","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
