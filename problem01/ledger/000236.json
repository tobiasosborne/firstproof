Verified: (1) Case partition exhaustive. (2) Conclusions faithful to inputs, no overclaiming. (3) Dependencies correctly listed. (4) Final conclusion matches parent claim 1.6.2 exactly. (5) Narrative is expository only. Minor: inference type 'modus_ponens' should be 'case_analysis' but this is cosmetic. Overall chain remains broken due to 1.6.2.10.2 REFUTED."}
