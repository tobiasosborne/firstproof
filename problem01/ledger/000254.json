This node addresses the two refutation issues: (a) the cubic term is RELEVANT (not irrelevant) in the RG sense, so the correct justification is quartic subordination; (b) spatial inhomogeneity of the lower-order couplings must be addressed explicitly.\n\nSETUP. The tilted potential is:\n\n  V_eps^{(alpha)}(phi) = lambda int_{T^3} :phi_eps^4:_{C_eps}(x) dx + delta_m_eps^2 int_{T^3} :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps}(x) dx - alpha int_{T^3} f(x) :phi_eps^k:_{C_eps}(x) dx\n\nThis is a Wick polynomial potential of the general form V(phi) = sum_{j=0}^{4} int_{T^3} g_j(x) :phi_eps^j:_{C_eps}(x) dx with:\n\n- g_4(x) = lambda \u003e 0 (constant, strictly positive)\n- g_3(x) = -alpha f(x) if k=3; zero if k=2\n- g_2(x) = delta_m_eps^2 - alpha f(x) if k=2; delta_m_eps^2 if k=3\n- g_1(x) = g_0(x) = 0\n\nWe establish five structural properties (P1)--(P5).\n\n(P1) QUARTIC POSITIVITY: g_4 = lambda \u003e 0. The perturbation has Wick degree k \u003c= 3 \u003c 4 and does NOT affect the quartic coupling. This is the leading-order term and determines the large-field behavior.\n\n(P2) SMOOTH COEFFICIENTS: f is in C^inf(T^3) by hypothesis. All g_j(x) are smooth functions on T^3. In particular, ||g_j||_{C^r(T^3)} \u003c infinity for every r \u003e= 0 and every j. The coefficients g_1, g_0 are identically zero. The coefficient g_4 = lambda is constant. For j in {2,3}, the function g_j is either constant or of the form (constant) - alpha f(x), hence smooth with all C^r norms bounded by constants depending only on alpha, f, and the fixed parameters of the theory.\n\n(P3) MASS COUNTERTERM: The coefficient of :phi_eps^2: in V_eps^{(alpha)} contains the mass counterterm delta_m_eps^2 (the same as in V_eps). When k=2, the tilted potential shifts this to delta_m_eps^2 - alpha f(x). The logarithmically divergent part of the mass counterterm delta_m_eps^2 cancels the one-loop divergence from C_eps(0), which is x-independent on T^3 (since the covariance is translation-invariant on the torus). The smooth, bounded, eps-independent perturbation -alpha f(x) does NOT alter the divergent part of the mass renormalization. Therefore the Wick renormalization and mass counterterm structure is preserved.\n\n(P4) CUBIC SUBORDINATION (k=3 CASE): The cubic term -alpha int_{T^3} f(x) :phi_eps^3:(x) dx has a RELEVANT coupling in the RG sense: standard power counting in d=3 gives the engineering dimension of the coupling for int phi^3 dx as d - 3(d-2)/2 = 3 - 3/2 = 3/2 \u003e 0. We do NOT claim RG irrelevance. Instead, we establish that the cubic term is SUBORDINATE to the quartic term via Young s inequality, which suffices for the Boue-Dupuis variational analysis in the sibling node 1.6.2.10.2.3.\n\nSpecifically, we work within the Boue-Dupuis framework of node 1.6.2.10.2.3 where, after taking expectations, the tilted potential reduces to a DETERMINISTIC functional of h = I_u (the drift):\n\n  E[V_eps^{(alpha)}(X + I_u)] = lambda int_{T^3} h_eps(x)^4 dx + delta_m_eps^2 int_{T^3} h_eps(x)^2 dx - alpha int_{T^3} f(x) h_eps(x)^k dx\n\n(using the Wick shift formula and E[:X_eps^j:] = 0 for j \u003e= 1, as shown in node 1.6.2.10.2.3, Step 3.2).\n\nFor k=3, applying POINTWISE Young s inequality to the real-valued integrand at each x in T^3: for any eta \u003e 0 and any t in R,\n\n  |alpha f(x)| |t|^3 \u003c= eta lambda t^4 + C(eta) |alpha f(x)|^4 / lambda^3\n\nwhere C(eta) = (3/4)(4 eta / 3)^{-3} (4-3)/4 = (3/4)(3/(4 eta))^3 (1/4) = 27/(256 eta^3). This is Young s inequality with conjugate exponents 4/3 and 4: writing |alpha f(x)| |t|^3 = (eta^{3/4} lambda^{3/4} |t|^3) * (|alpha f(x)| / (eta^{3/4} lambda^{3/4})), then by Young ab \u003c= a^{4/3}/(4/3) + b^4/4.\n\nChoosing eta = 1/4: for every x in T^3 and every t in R,\n\n  lambda t^4 - |alpha f(x)| |t|^3 \u003e= lambda t^4 - (lambda/4) t^4 - C_0 |alpha|^4 |f(x)|^4 / lambda^3\n  = (3 lambda / 4) t^4 - C_0 |alpha|^4 |f(x)|^4 / lambda^3\n\nwhere C_0 = 27/256. Integrating over T^3 with t = h_eps(x):\n\n  lambda int h_eps^4 dx - |alpha| int |f| |h_eps|^3 dx \u003e= (3 lambda / 4) int h_eps^4 dx - C_0 |alpha|^4 lambda^{-3} ||f||_{L^4}^4\n\nTherefore:\n  lambda int h_eps^4 dx - alpha int f(x) h_eps^3 dx \u003e= (3 lambda / 4) int h_eps^4 dx - C_0 |alpha|^4 lambda^{-3} ||f||_{L^4}^4\n\nThis lower bound is INDEPENDENT of eps and of h. The cubic term is subordinate to the quartic: V_eps^{(alpha)} retains at least 3/4 of the quartic coercivity, at the cost of a finite constant depending on alpha, f, lambda but NOT on eps.\n\nFor k=2, the analogous (and easier) bound gives:\n  lambda int h_eps^4 dx - |alpha| int |f| h_eps^2 dx \u003e= (lambda/2) int h_eps^4 dx - (alpha^2 / (2 lambda)) ||f||_{L^2}^2\n\nby Young with exponents (2,2).\n\nIn both cases, the KEY CONCLUSION is:\n\n  E[V_eps^{(alpha)}(X + I_u)] \u003e= c(lambda, k) int h_eps^4 dx + delta_m_eps^2 int h_eps^2 dx - K(alpha, f, k, lambda)   ...(SUB)\n\nwhere c(lambda, k) \u003e 0 (specifically c = 3 lambda/4 for k=3, c = lambda/2 for k=2) and K is a FINITE constant independent of eps and h. This is the input to the Polchinski flow analysis in node 1.6.2.10.2.3.\n\n(P5) SPATIAL INHOMOGENEITY: BG (2020) treats the Phi^4_3 theory with constant (translation-invariant) couplings on T^3. The tilted potential V_eps^{(alpha)} has spatially varying lower-order coefficients g_j(x) for j \u003c= 3. We address why the BG framework extends to this case.\n\n(P5a) LOCALITY OF THE POLCHINSKI EQUATION: The Polchinski flow equation for the effective potential is LOCAL in position space (BG 2020, equation (4.1)). Concretely, the flow equation for the running potential V_t at RG scale t takes the form:\n\n  d/dt V_t(phi) = (1/2) int [Delta_t(x) (delta^2 V_t / delta phi(x)^2) - (delta V_t / delta phi(x))^2] dx\n\nwhere Delta_t(x) is the single-scale covariance kernel evaluated at coinciding points. This equation acts pointwise in x, so spatially dependent coefficients propagate through the flow without mixing different spatial locations in the coupling evolution.\n\n(P5b) BOUNDED, SMOOTH, eps-INDEPENDENT PERTURBATION: The spatially varying part of the lower-order couplings is -alpha f(x), which satisfies:\n  (i) ||alpha f||_{C^r(T^3)} \u003c infinity for every r \u003e= 0 (since f in C^inf(T^3)),\n  (ii) alpha f(x) is INDEPENDENT of eps,\n  (iii) ||alpha f||_{L^inf(T^3)} = |alpha| ||f||_{L^inf(T^3)} is bounded.\n\n(P5c) MASS RENORMALIZATION IS UNAFFECTED: The mass counterterm delta_m_eps^2 is determined by the condition that the running mass at the IR scale remains O(1). The divergent contribution to the running mass comes from the one-loop diagram, which is proportional to lambda * C_eps(0) ~ lambda * c * log(1/eps). This contribution is TRANSLATION-INVARIANT (since C_eps(0) = C_eps(x,x) is x-independent on the torus). Adding a smooth, bounded, eps-independent function -alpha f(x) to the mass shifts the running mass at every RG scale by an O(|alpha| ||f||_inf) amount, which is uniformly bounded and does not interfere with the cancellation of the logarithmic divergence.\n\n(P5d) STABILITY OF PARTITION FUNCTION BOUNDS: The BG Polchinski flow analysis establishes that exp(-C_-) \u003c= Z_eps \u003c= exp(C_+) uniformly in eps (BG 2020, Proposition 4.3). By (P4/SUB), the tilted potential V_eps^{(alpha)} preserves a positive fraction of the quartic coupling and differs from V_eps only by bounded lower-order terms. By BG (2021, Section 2) and Barashkov (PhD thesis, 2020, Chapter 3), the Polchinski flow bounds are STABLE under perturbations of the lower-order couplings that are bounded in C^0 norm. Since the perturbation -alpha int f(x) :phi_eps^k:(x) dx has smooth coefficients bounded uniformly in eps and Wick degree k \u003c= 3 \u003c 4, it satisfies the stability hypotheses. Therefore the two-sided partition function bounds extend to Z_eps^{(alpha)}.\n\nMore precisely: the proof of the partition function upper bound in BG (2020) proceeds via the Boue-Dupuis variational formula (their Section 3), which reduces to the deterministic bound (SUB) above. The lower-order perturbation does NOT enter the argument for the quartic coupling flow (Proposition 4.1) because it does not affect g_4 = lambda. The perturbation enters only through the lower-order coupling flow, where it contributes bounded, eps-independent corrections that are absorbed into the O(1) constants.\n\nCONCLUSION: The tilted potential V_eps^{(alpha)} is a Wick polynomial potential with:\n  (P1) strictly positive quartic coupling lambda \u003e 0, unchanged by the tilt,\n  (P2) smooth coefficients with all C^r norms bounded independently of eps,\n  (P3) the same mass counterterm structure, with the logarithmic divergence cancellation unaffected,\n  (P4) cubic (or quadratic) perturbation that is SUBORDINATE to the quartic, preserving coercivity up to eps-independent constants,\n  (P5) spatially inhomogeneous lower-order couplings that are compatible with the BG Polchinski flow framework due to locality, boundedness, and stability.\n\nThese properties provide the structural input needed for the partition function bound in node 1.6.2.10.2.3.\n\nREFERENCES: BG = Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020), Sections 3-4, Proposition 4.1 and 4.3; BG (2021), Section 2 (stability under perturbations); Barashkov PhD thesis (2020), Chapter 3; Young s inequality (standard, e.g., Lieb-Loss, Analysis, Theorem 2.4).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"66f7bf791307440d703a619aafc42689b6c4b64fdffd2f9499806b50481dddd6","created":"2026-02-08T21:15:30.586874166Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
