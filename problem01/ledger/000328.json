The node invokes 'uniqueness of the Phi^4_3 measure with given (lambda, m^2)' but this uniqueness result (Hairer 2014 Thm 1.1, GH 2019 Thm 1.3, BG 2020 Thm 1) says the limit of Z_eps^{-1} exp(-V_eps) dmu_0 does not depend on the regularization scheme. It does NOT say that DIFFERENT potentials (V_eps vs V_eps^L, which differ by a divergent perturbation) produce the SAME limit. V_eps^L = V_eps + delta_m_eps^2(-2 psi_eps phi_eps + psi_eps^2) differs from V_eps by terms with DIVERGENT coefficient delta_m_eps^2 ~ log(1/eps). Under the change of variables chi = phi - psi, V_eps^L becomes lambda :(chi+psi)^4: + delta_m_eps^2 :chi^2: which expands to the standard Phi^4_3 potential for chi PLUS cubic/quadratic/linear terms (4*lambda*psi :chi^3:, 6*lambda*psi^2 :chi^2:, etc.) with smooth eps-independent coefficients. These lower-order perturbations change the limiting measure (e.g., the cubic term breaks Z_2 symmetry). The correct identification would be: the limit of mu_eps^L as a measure on chi=phi-psi is a PERTURBED Phi^4_3 measure, not mu itself.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
