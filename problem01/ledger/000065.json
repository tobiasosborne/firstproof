The mu_0 argument is correct but DOES NOT transfer to mu because mu PERP mu_0 (Barashkov-Gubinelli 2021). The proof needs an independent argument under mu. A correct justification: the set {phi : \u003cpsi,phi\u003e=0} is a closed hyperplane of codimension 1 in C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3), and the Phi^4_3 measure mu has full support in C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) (proven by Hairer-Mattingly, or via the stochastic quantization dynamics). Any Borel probability measure with full support gives zero mass to any proper closed affine subspace. This gap does not affect the main conclusions of the node.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
