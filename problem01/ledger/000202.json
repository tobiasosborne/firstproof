The inference type should be 'decomposition' for nodes that break the claim into sub-claims, and 'deduction' or 'external' for nodes that invoke cited results. This was previously flagged in challenge ch-3db45f8728791d0b (superseded) but has not been corrected in the repaired nodes.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
