Since psi in C^inf(T^3), the pairings integral psi :phi^3: dx and integral psi^2 :phi^2: dx are well-defined real-valued random variables under mu. This follows from the regularity theory for the Phi^4_3 field (Hairer regularity structures / Gubinelli-Imkeller-Perkowski paracontrolled distributions).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"ab639161e52130a0536a738f607dcc72d3e088f39da0cd68110812d5be59ed3e","created":"2026-02-08T14:41:03.33188782Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
