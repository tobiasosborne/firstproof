The supremum over the spatial variable x and the dyadic index j requires an entropy/chaining argument (standard in Gaussian chaos theory) to verify that no additional p-dependent factors are introduced. While this gap is fillable with standard tools, it should be made explicit.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
