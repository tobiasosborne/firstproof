(1) Wick square definition :f^2:_C = f^2 - C(0) is standard and correctly applied. (2) C_eps is the correct covariance since psi_eps is deterministic. (3) C(0) terms cancel exactly in the difference. (4) Expanding (f-g)^2 - f^2 = -2fg + g^2 gives -2 psi_eps phi_eps + psi_eps^2. (5) No Wick constants remain. Purely algebraic and correct."}
