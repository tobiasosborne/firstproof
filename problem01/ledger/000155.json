{"type":"node_created","timestamp":"2026-02-08T19:39:17.658350226Z","node":{"id":"1.6.1.6","type":"claim","statement":"REPAIRED PROOF (addressing challenges ch-8c55446415712bd8, ch-6e958401a84a12b3, ch-e0830535105a4901):\n\nWe establish the well-definedness of the smeared Wick powers \u003cpsi, :phi^3:\u003e and \u003cpsi^2, :phi^2:\u003e as L^p(mu) random variables in four steps.\n\nSTEP 1 (Node 1.6.1.1 -- Field regularity, UNCHANGED): The Phi^4_3 measure mu on T^3 is supported on C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3) for every delta \u003e 0. This is Hairer (2014) Theorem 10.7 and Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020) Theorem 1.1.\n\nSTEP 2 (Node 1.6.1.2 -- Wick power regularity, REPAIRED -- Error 3): Under mu, the renormalized Wick powers converge: (i) :phi^2: in C^{-1-delta}(T^3) for every delta \u003e 0. (ii) :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-delta}(T^3) for every delta \u003e 0. Convergence is mu-a.s. and in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1. REPAIR of Error 3 (reversed Besov inclusion): The original proof stated C^{-3/2-3delta} subset C^{-3/2-delta}, which is backwards since -3/2-3delta \u003c -3/2-delta implies C^{-3/2-delta} subset C^{-3/2-3delta} (lower regularity spaces are larger). The CORRECTED argument is: In Hairer regularity structures framework (2014, Section 10), the symbol Xi^3 has homogeneity 3(-1/2-delta_0) = -3/2-3delta_0. The reconstruction theorem (Theorem 3.10) yields :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-3delta_0} for any delta_0 \u003e 0. For any TARGET regularity index delta \u003e 0, choose delta_0 = delta/3. Then :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-3(delta/3)} = C^{-3/2-delta}. Since delta \u003e 0 was arbitrary, :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-delta} for every delta \u003e 0. Analogously for :phi^2:, the reconstruction gives C^{-1-2delta_0}; choosing delta_0 = delta/2 yields C^{-1-delta} for any target delta \u003e 0. The L^p(mu) bounds E_mu[||:phi^k:||_{C^{-k/2-delta}}^p] \u003c infinity follow from Mourrat-Weber (2017, Proposition 3.2) and Gubinelli-Hofmanova (2019, Proposition 2.3).\n\nSTEP 3 (Node 1.6.1.3 -- Duality pairings, REPAIRED -- Error 1): Given :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-delta}(T^3) and :phi^2: in C^{-1-delta}(T^3), and psi in C^inf(T^3), the pairings are well-defined. REPAIR of Error 1 (wrong duality condition): The correct condition for the duality pairing of C^{s_1} x C^{s_2} (with s_2 \u003c 0) to be well-defined as a continuous bilinear map is s_1 + s_2 \u003e 0. In the notation C^alpha x C^{-beta} with alpha, beta \u003e 0, this translates to alpha - beta \u003e 0, i.e., alpha \u003e beta (NOT the previously stated alpha + beta \u003e 0, which is trivially true and proves nothing). (a) For \u003cpsi, :phi^3:\u003e: We pair psi in C^inf subset C^{3/2+2delta} with :phi^3: in C^{-3/2-delta}. The regularity sum is (3/2+2delta) + (-3/2-delta) = delta \u003e 0. Since delta \u003e 0, the pairing is well-defined and continuous. Equivalently, alpha = 3/2+2delta, beta = 3/2+delta, and alpha - beta = delta \u003e 0. (b) For \u003cpsi^2, :phi^2:\u003e: We pair psi^2 in C^inf subset C^{1+2delta} with :phi^2: in C^{-1-delta}. The regularity sum is (1+2delta) + (-1-delta) = delta \u003e 0. Since delta \u003e 0, the pairing is well-defined and continuous. Measurability: These bilinear pairings are continuous, hence Borel measurable, so phi |-\u003e \u003cpsi, :phi^3:\u003e and phi |-\u003e \u003cpsi^2, :phi^2:\u003e are measurable functions from (D'(T^3), B(D'(T^3))) to (R, B(R)).\n\nSTEP 4 (Node 1.6.1.4 -- L^p integrability, REPAIRED -- Error 2): REPAIR of Error 2 (borderline duality bound): The original used ||psi||_{C^{k/2+delta}} * ||:phi^k:||_{C^{-k/2-delta}}, giving regularity sum (k/2+delta)+(-k/2-delta) = 0, which is the borderline case where the continuous bilinear estimate FAILS. CORRECTED bound: By the continuity of the duality pairing (Step 3 with strictly positive regularity gap), for k = 2, 3: |\u003cpsi, :phi^k:\u003e| \u003c= C_delta * ||psi||_{C^{k/2+2delta}} * ||:phi^k:||_{C^{-k/2-delta}} where C_delta is the operator norm of the bilinear pairing C^{k/2+2delta} x C^{-k/2-delta} -\u003e R (finite since regularity sum = (k/2+2delta)+(-k/2-delta) = delta \u003e 0). Since psi in C^inf is fixed, ||psi||_{C^{k/2+2delta}} is a finite constant. Therefore: E_mu[|\u003cpsi, :phi^k:\u003e|^p] \u003c= C_delta^p * ||psi||_{C^{k/2+2delta}}^p * E_mu[||:phi^k:||_{C^{-k/2-delta}}^p]. By the uniform moment bounds from Step 2 (Mourrat-Weber 2017, Proposition 3.2; Gubinelli-Hofmanova 2019, Proposition 2.3), E_mu[||:phi^k:||_{C^{-k/2-delta}}^p] \u003c infinity for all p \u003e= 1 and k = 2, 3. Hence \u003cpsi, :phi^k:\u003e in L^p(mu) for all p \u003e= 1.
