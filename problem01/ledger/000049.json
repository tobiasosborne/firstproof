We compute the two Wick squares separately and then take their difference.\n\n**Step 1: Expand :(f - g)^2:_C.**\nBy the definition of Wick ordering,\n  :(f - g)^2:_C = (f - g)^2 - C.\n\n**Step 2: Expand :f^2:_C.**\nBy the same definition,\n  :f^2:_C = f^2 - C.\n\n**Step 3: Form the difference.**\n  :(f - g)^2:_C - :f^2:_C\n    = [(f - g)^2 - C] - [f^2 - C]\n    = (f - g)^2 - C - f^2 + C.\n\n**Step 4: Cancel the Wick constant C.**\nThe terms -C and +C cancel exactly:\n  = (f - g)^2 - f^2.\n\nThis is the key observation: the covariance constant C = C_eps(0) drops out completely. The result is independent of the Wick-ordering prescription.\n\n**Step 5: Expand (f - g)^2.**\n  (f - g)^2 = f^2 - 2fg + g^2.\n\nTherefore:\n  (f - g)^2 - f^2 = f^2 - 2fg + g^2 - f^2 = -2fg + g^2.\n\n**Step 6: Substitute back.**\nRestoring the original notation f = phi_eps, g = psi_eps:\n  :(phi_eps - psi_eps)^2:_{C_eps} - :phi_eps^2:_{C_eps} = -2 psi_eps phi_eps + psi_eps^2.\n\n**Conclusion.**\n(i) The identity holds by pure algebra — specifically, by expanding the squares and cancelling. No analytic estimates or convergence arguments are needed.\n(ii) The Wick constant C_eps(0) cancels in Step 4 and does not appear in the final expression.\n(iii) The result -2 psi_eps phi_eps + psi_eps^2 is a polynomial in phi_eps and psi_eps with no dependence on C_eps(0). In particular, it contains no Wick-ordered quantities; every term is an ordinary pointwise product of fields.\n(iv) This cancellation is not accidental: the Wick subtraction :f^2:_C = f^2 - C shifts f^2 by a constant independent of f. When taking differences of Wick squares evaluated at different field arguments but with the same covariance, the constant shift always cancels.
