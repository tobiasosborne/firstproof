{"type":"node_validated","timestamp":"2026-02-08T18:18:58.626538158Z","node_id":"1.4.1","note":"VERIFIED. All six verification checks pass: (1) Wick polynomial definitions :f^4:_C = f^4 - 6C(0)f^2 + 3C(0)^2, :f^3:_C = f^3 - 3C(0)f, :f^2:_C = f^2 - C(0) are correct (verified against standard Hermite polynomials He_n). (2) Algebraic computation independently verified: binomial expansion of (f-g)^4 and (f-g)^2, substitution, and regrouping by powers of g all correct. (3) Wick power identification correct: terms -4g(f^3-3Cf) = -4g:f^3: and 6g^2(f^2-C) = 6g^2:f^2: follow directly from definitions. (4) Cancellation claim verified: all C_eps(0)-dependent terms (specifically +12Cfg and -6Cg^2) are fully absorbed into Wick monomials :f^3: and :f^2:; residual terms -4g^3f + g^4 are C-independent. (5) Pointwise evaluation justified: phi_eps is smooth for eps\u003e0 (mollified field), psi_eps is smooth and deterministic. (6) Integration over T^3 justified: compact domain, smooth integrands for eps\u003e0. Also verified that Wick ordering of (phi_eps - psi_eps) w.r.t. C_eps is correct since psi_eps is deterministic and does not affect the covariance."}
