Step 3.4 then provides a completely different argument (Polchinski flow) that is presented as a 'resolution' rather than the actual proof. The result is that the proof reads as: (heuristic with errors) -\u003e (failed attempt) -\u003e (wave hands at external result). A coherent proof would: (1) State upfront that the Boue-Dupuis variational formula will be bounded using the BG Polchinski flow; (2) Invoke the structural verification from 1.6.2.10.2.2.1 showing V_eps^{(alpha)} satisfies BG's hypotheses; (3) Apply BG Proposition 4.1/4.3 to conclude the partition function bound. Steps 3.1-3.2 should be clearly labeled as motivational heuristic, and Step 3.3's failed naive approach should be clearly separated from the actual proof.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
