The passage from finite-dimensional BL to the infinite-dimensional setting requires: (a) verification that the lattice Phi^4 measures converge to the continuum mu_eps in the appropriate sense, (b) that the variance functional is lower-semicontinuous under this convergence. These are standard facts but should be cited explicitly (e.g., via the Glimm-Jaffe or Gross references for BL in infinite dimensions, or via the Helffer-Sjostrand approach). The lattice argument also requires checking that on the lattice, the single-site potential lambda t^4 + delta_m^2 t^2 is convex, which requires delta_m^2 \u003e= -2 sqrt(3 lambda). This condition should be verified explicitly for the counterterm values used in the Phi^4_3 construction.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
