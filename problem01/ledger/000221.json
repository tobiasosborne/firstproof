Step A.3 was supposed to transfer this bound from mu_0 to mu_eps using Brascamp-Lieb, but Brascamp-Lieb fails (the Hessian of the Wick quartic is not non-negative). The fallback argument cites 'Hairer (2014), Theorem 10.7; Gubinelli-Hofmanova (2019), Section 3' for the p-dependence under mu_eps. However, these references establish stochastic estimates for the Wick-power objects primarily under the Gaussian measure (or at the level of the PDE/SPD construction). They do NOT directly establish the L^p growth rate (A_k * p^{k/2})^p for moments of Besov norms under mu_eps. The claim that 'the Phi^4_3 interaction only improves the bounds' is asserted without proof. Without Brascamp-Lieb or an alternative comparison mechanism, there is no justified pathway from the mu_0 hypercontractivity bound to the claimed mu_eps bound.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
