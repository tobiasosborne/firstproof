(2) For k=2, E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi^2:\u003e)] \u003c infinity for all alpha in R, by quartic domination at the regularized level and Fatou's lemma in the limit (node 1.6.2.2). (3) For k=3, E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi^3:\u003e)] \u003c infinity for all alpha in R, by the same quartic-domination strategy with Young's inequality (node 1.6.2.3). This establishes the claim of node 1.6.2 in full. Note: The key mechanism for k=2,3 is that the quartic interaction -lambda integral phi^4 dx in the Phi^4_3 density provides super-quadratic and super-cubic decay, so that any polynomial perturbation of degree \u003c= 3 can be absorbed into the quartic potential via Young's inequality. The passage from regularized to limiting measure uses the L^p convergence of Wick powers (node 1.6.1) and Fatou's lemma.
