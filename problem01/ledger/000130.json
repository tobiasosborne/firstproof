Under mu_eps (and in the limit mu), the linear functional \u003cpsi, phi\u003e has sub-Gaussian tails with constants uniform in eps. Therefore E_{mu_eps}[exp(L_eps)] = E_{mu_eps}[exp(2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi, phi\u003e)] is finite for each eps (though growing). The normalization constant -log E_{mu_eps}[exp(Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps)] absorbs this growth. The key point: the normalized quantity R_eps is a ratio that remains bounded in L^p(mu) for suitable p, even as individual terms diverge.","new_statement":"(Absorption of the divergent linear term — corrected) The divergent linear term L_eps = 2 delta_m_eps^2 \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e acts as an exponential tilt of the regularized measure mu_eps. Three properties are established: (I) Under mu_eps, the linear functional \u003cpsi_eps, phi_eps\u003e has sub-Gaussian tails with variance proxy sigma^2 = ||psi||_{H^{-1}}^2, UNIFORM in eps. (II) For each eps \u003e 0, E_{mu_eps}[exp(L_eps)] is finite (though growing as exp(C(log 1/eps)^2)), so the normalization Z_eps = E_{mu_eps}[exp(Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps)] is well-defined and positive. (III) For each fixed eps \u003e 0, R_eps is in L^p(mu_eps) for ALL p \u003e= 1, because the quartic decay of mu_eps dominates the at-most-cubic growth of the exponent. However, for any fixed p \u003e 1, E_{mu_eps}[R_eps^p] diverges as eps -\u003e 0 (growing as exp(C(p^2-1)(log 1/eps)^2)). The uniform integrability of {R_eps} and L^1 convergence to a valid RN derivative are deferred to node 1.6.","owner":"prover-11"}
