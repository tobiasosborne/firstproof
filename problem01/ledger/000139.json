The Brascamp-Lieb inequality only gives an UPPER bound on variance. A lower bound requires a separate argument (e.g., that the covariance C_W of the modified Gaussian satisfies \u003cpsi_eps, C_W psi_eps\u003e \u003e= c_0, which follows from C_W \u003c= C and the fact that sigma_eps^2 has a positive limit, but should be stated). This is minor because Claim III.2 is a negative result (divergence of L^p norms) that no subsequent node depends on for a positive conclusion.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
