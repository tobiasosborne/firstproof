We have:\n\nE_P[Y_eps^{1+delta}] = E_P[exp((1+delta) Psi_eps^{ren}(Phi_eps))]\n= E_{mu_eps}[exp((1+delta) Psi_eps^{ren})]   (since law(Phi_eps) = mu_eps under P).\n\nNow, (1+delta) Psi_eps^{ren} = sum_{j=1}^4 (1+delta) c_j \u003cf_j, :phi_eps^{k_j}:_{C_eps}\u003e where the terms and coefficients are as in node 1.5.1. By Holder's inequality with exponents (4,4,4,4):\n\nE_{mu_eps}[exp((1+delta) Psi_eps^{ren})] \u003c= prod_{j=1}^4 (E_{mu_eps}[exp(4(1+delta) c_j \u003cf_j, :phi_eps^{k_j}:_{C_eps}\u003e)])^{1/4}.\n\nFor each j, the exponential moment E_{mu_eps}[exp(alpha \u003cf_j, :phi_eps^{k_j}:\u003e)] is bounded uniformly in eps by node 1.6.2.10.2.4 (validated): for any alpha in R and k in {1,2,3}, there exists M(alpha, f, k) independent of eps such that E_{mu_eps}[exp(alpha \u003cf, :phi_eps^k:\u003e)] \u003c= M(alpha, f, k). Taking alpha = 4(1+delta) c_j and f = f_j, k = k_j:\n\nE_{mu_eps}[exp(4(1+delta) c_j \u003cf_j, :phi_eps^{k_j}:\u003e)] \u003c= M(4(1+delta) c_j, f_j, k_j) \u003c infinity, uniformly in eps.\n\nTherefore: sup_{eps} E_P[Y_eps^{1+delta}] \u003c= prod_{j=1}^4 M(4(1+delta) c_j, f_j, k_j)^{1/4} \u003c infinity.\n\nCONCLUSION: {Y_eps} is uniformly integrable on (Omega, P), for ANY delta \u003e 0 (i.e., we actually have uniform L^p(P) bounds for ALL p \u003e= 1).\n\nCRITICAL DISTINCTION: This uniform integrability is for {exp(Psi_eps^{ren})} under the FIXED measure P on the Skorokhod space. This is NOT the same as uniform integrability of {R_eps = exp(Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps + K_eps)} under the CHANGING measures {mu_eps}. The latter is blocked (as noted in the parent node). The former works because Psi_eps^{ren} does not include the divergent L_eps term, and the exponential integrability of individual Wick power pairings (node 1.6.2.10.2.4) provides the needed uniform moment bounds.\n\nDEPENDENCIES: Nodes 1.6.2.10.2.4 (uniform exponential bounds under mu_eps), 1.5.1 (decomposition of Psi^{ren} into terms), 1.6.3.2 (Skorokhod coupling).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"4c25354cb581c2e2b25ae9314c1f6ecd77876d7d6b539c59a7268e99d6d33b8e","created":"2026-02-08T22:05:55.15765388Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
