Converting Wick powers to raw powers: the constant terms include -alpha C_eps(0) int f dx and -3 lambda C_eps(0)^2 |T^3|, which are O(C_eps(0)^2) ~ O(eps^{-2}). Even after the mass counterterm absorbs the leading 6 lambda C_eps(0) int phi^2 divergence, the pure-constant contributions to the exponent diverge as eps -\u003e 0. The Z_eps^{-1} normalization does NOT cancel these because Z_eps^{-1} contains exp(+3 lambda C_eps(0)^2 |T^3| + delta_m^2 C_eps(0)|T^3|) from its own Wick-to-raw conversion, but the alpha-dependent constant -alpha C_eps(0) int f dx remains. The bound therefore grows at least as exp(|alpha| C_eps(0) |int f|) which diverges, making Fatou vacuous. The proof must work with the combined Wick-ordered quantity \u003cf, :phi_eps^2:\u003e without decomposing into divergent raw-power pieces, or use a fundamentally different argument.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
