Since psi in C^inf subset C^{3/2+delta'} for any delta' \u003e 0, and the duality pairing between C^alpha and C^{-beta} is well-defined as a continuous bilinear map whenever alpha + beta \u003e 0 (which holds since (3/2+delta') + (3/2+delta) \u003e 0 for any delta, delta' \u003e 0), this gives a well-defined real number. (b) \u003cpsi^2, :phi^2:\u003e := integral_{T^3} psi(x)^2 :phi^2:(x) dx is the pairing of C^{1+delta'}(T^3) with C^{-1-delta}(T^3). Since psi^2 in C^inf subset C^{1+delta'} for any delta' \u003e 0, and (1+delta') + (1+delta) \u003e 0, this is also well-defined. The continuity of these bilinear pairings ensures that phi |-\u003e \u003cpsi, :phi^3:\u003e and phi |-\u003e \u003cpsi^2, :phi^2:\u003e are measurable maps from (D'(T^3), B(D'(T^3))) to (R, B(R)), hence well-defined random variables under any Borel probability measure on D'(T^3), in particular under mu.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"1b8cc51354554b4d6db2e487474b0c16f08112a08ee8dfa46fc4fc9499b5ea11","created":"2026-02-08T19:33:31.0698787Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
