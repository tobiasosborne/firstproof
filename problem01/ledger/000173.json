The proof writes 'E_mu[exp(...)] \u003c= liminf_{eps-\u003e0} E_{mu_eps}[exp(...)]' but Fatou's lemma requires a FIXED measure. The statement mixes the limiting measure mu on the LHS with regularized measures mu_eps on the RHS. Standard Fatou under mu would give E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf,:phi^2:\u003e)] \u003c= liminf E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf,:phi_eps^2:\u003e)], which requires bounding the expectation under mu (not mu_eps). Under mu, the functional \u003cf,:phi_eps^2:\u003e is bounded by C||:phi^2:||_{C^{-1-delta}}||f||_{C^{1+delta}} independently of eps, but proving that ||:phi^2:||_{C^{-1-delta}} has finite exponential moments under mu requires a separate argument that is not provided. For changing measures, one needs either a coupling (common probability space with a.s. convergence) or Skorokhod's representation theorem plus uniform integrability, neither of which is invoked.","severity":"critical","raised_by":""}
