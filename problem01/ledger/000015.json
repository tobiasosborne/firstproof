Proof strategy: We construct an explicit Radon-Nikodym derivative d(T_psi* mu)/d(mu) using UV regularization. The proof has four stages: (A) compute the RN derivative for regularized measures mu_eps via Wick calculus, (B) identify the renormalized limit as eps -\u003e 0 by separating convergent Wick-power terms from the divergent mass-counterterm contribution, (C) establish L^1(mu) integrability of the limit using sub-Gaussian tail estimates for the Phi^4_3 measure, and (D) conclude mutual absolute continuity by symmetry (psi -\u003e -psi). The key insight is that the interaction difference V(phi+psi)-V(phi) involves only lower-order Wick powers smeared against smooth functions of psi, requiring no new UV renormalization beyond the mass counterterm already present in the construction of mu.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"636eeb904681688c8d2a00c7114d53fb1f6a4bbff53e4d963ca6714ef703ef85","created":"2026-02-08T14:39:50.077882532Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
