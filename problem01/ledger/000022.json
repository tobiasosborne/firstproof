Replacing psi by -psi: define S(phi) = lim_{eps-\u003e0} d(T_{-psi}* mu_eps)/d(mu_eps)(phi). By the identical argument, S is a well-defined RN derivative giving T_{-psi}* mu \u003c\u003c mu. But T_{-psi}* mu \u003c\u003c mu is equivalent to mu \u003c\u003c T_psi* mu (since T_{-psi} = T_psi^{-1}). Combining: T_psi* mu \u003c\u003c mu and mu \u003c\u003c T_psi* mu, hence T_psi* mu ~ mu.
