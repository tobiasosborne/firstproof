This single sum CONVERGES in d=3 by power counting: the summand decays as |k|^{-4} and sum |k|^{-4} converges for d=3 since 4 \u003e d=3. The correct expression for the second-order mass counterterm involves the SUNSET DIAGRAM, which is a double sum (convolution of three propagators). The CONCLUSION delta_m_eps^2 ~ c' lambda^2 log(1/eps) is correct (standard result for Phi^4_3), but the intermediate Fourier formula is wrong. This does not affect the node's conclusions since only the asymptotic rate is used.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
