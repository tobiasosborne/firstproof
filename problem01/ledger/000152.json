Three errors found, two blocking: (1) MAJOR [1.6.1.3]: Duality pairing condition stated as 'alpha + beta \u003e 0' is wrong — correct condition is alpha - beta \u003e 0 (i.e., alpha \u003e beta) in the notation used, or equivalently s_1 + s_2 \u003e 0 for the sum of actual Besov regularities. (2) MAJOR [1.6.1.4]: Duality bound uses regularity sum = 0 (borderline case where the bilinear estimate fails); must use a strictly positive gap, e.g., pair C^{k/2+2delta} with C^{-k/2-delta}. (3) MINOR [1.6.1.2]: Besov space inclusion direction reversed. All conclusions are ultimately CORRECT — errors are expositional. Fix: replace alpha+beta\u003e0 with alpha-beta\u003e0, introduce regularity gap in duality bound, remove false inclusion.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"71e2d318cdbfb634b27dcdf2e6f27dd1463eb215f55d5b96a336013a6365fcb3","created":"2026-02-08T19:37:04.754856902Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
