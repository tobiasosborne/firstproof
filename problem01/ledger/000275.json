Steps (2a)-(2f) present a narrative of 'Polchinski RG flow with running couplings (lambda_j, m_j^2)' flowing from UV to IR, with the variational problem factored into independent scale-by-scale optimizations (Step 2c). This does NOT accurately describe the BG (2020) proof. The BG approach: (1) Applies the Boue-Dupuis formula to get a SINGLE variational problem over adapted drifts; (2) Establishes UNIFORM BOUNDS on the stochastic objects appearing in the variational functional using techniques from singular SPDEs (paracontrolled distributions); (3) Uses these bounds plus the quartic coercivity to show the variational functional is bounded below uniformly in eps; (4) Uses Gamma-convergence (their Section 4) to pass to the limit. BG do NOT factor the variational problem into independent scale-by-scale optimizations as described in (2c). BG do NOT track running couplings (lambda_j, m_j^2) through a Polchinski flow. The connection to Polchinski is that the HJB equation for the value function IS the Polchinski equation (this is the 'duality'), but the proof strategy is fundamentally different from what is described. The claim in (2d) about 'the quartic beta function in d=3' is perturbative RG language inappropriate for the non-perturbative BG approach. The CONCLUSION (uniform partition function bounds) is correct and does follow from the BG construction, but the intermediate argument (2a)-(2f) as written does not faithfully represent how BG achieves this. This is a significant gap because it means the reader cannot check the claimed logical chain against the source.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
