(II) Z := E_mu[exp(Psi^{ren})] satisfies 0 \u003c Z \u003c infinity (node 1.6.3.3). (III) For all bounded continuous G on X: E_{mu_eps}[G exp(Psi_eps^{ren})] -\u003e E_mu[G exp(Psi^{ren})] (Vitali applied to G * Y_eps with UI from 1.6.3.4). (IV) The probability measure rho := (exp(Psi^{ren})/Z) dmu is well-defined with E_mu[R] = 1, R \u003e 0 mu-a.s. (node 1.6.3.3). CORRECTION: The original claim of uniform integrability of R_eps = exp(Psi_eps^{ren} + L_eps + K_eps) via L^p bounds is WITHDRAWN. For any fixed p \u003e 1, E_{mu_eps}[R_eps^p] diverges as exp(C(p^2-1)(log 1/eps)^2) (node 1.5.4, validated). Instead, this node establishes UI of the RENORMALIZED factor exp(Psi_eps^{ren}) only (which excludes the divergent L_eps term). The full identification T_psi*mu = rho (handling the divergent L_eps tilt) is deferred to node 1.6.4.
