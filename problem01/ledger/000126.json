These failed attempts are presented as part of the proof rather than as scratchwork, making it difficult to distinguish the actual argument from abandoned approaches. The proof would benefit from: (a) removing the failed attempts or clearly marking them as such, and (b) presenting only the final argument. As written, a reader must trace through multiple dead ends (Holder decoupling, reverse-Holder, Paley-Zygmund, variational formula, hypercontractivity approach) before discovering that none of them yield the claimed uniform bound, and that the proof ultimately retreats to a weaker claim than originally stated.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
