The inclusion should be H^{-1}(T^3) SUBSET D'(T^3), i.e., distributions of negative Sobolev regularity are contained in the space of all distributions. The supset symbol is backwards. Additionally, the reference to arXiv:2112.05562 should be verified: this paper concerns the infinite-volume Phi^4_3 measure. For the torus (finite volume), the sub-Gaussian tails follow from the Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020) variational approach (arXiv:1911.10114) combined with Brascamp-Lieb, which should be cited instead or in addition.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
