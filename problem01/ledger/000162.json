By the definition of sub-Gaussian tails (Definition sub_Gaussian_tails), the Phi^4_3 measure mu satisfies: for every continuous linear functional L on D'(T^3), there exists C_L \u003e 0 such that E_mu[exp(alpha L(phi))] \u003c= exp(C_L alpha^2) for all alpha in R. Setting L(phi) = \u003cf, phi\u003e, which is a continuous linear functional on D'(T^3) (since f in C^inf(T^3) subset H^1(T^3) subset the Cameron-Martin space, and \u003cf, phi\u003e extends continuously to phi in H^{-1}(T^3) supset D'(T^3)), we obtain E_mu[exp(alpha \u003cf, phi\u003e)] \u003c= exp(C_f alpha^2) \u003c infinity for all alpha in R, where C_f depends on f through ||f||_{H^1}. This establishes exponential integrability for k=1. Reference: Barashkov-Gubinelli (2021, arXiv:2112.05562), Theorem 1.3, which proves sub-Gaussian concentration for the infinite-volume Phi^4_3 measure. The finite-volume (torus) case follows a fortiori from the same variational techniques.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"3953f862e9eadb5192481a0a29eef3af08e15db486620aab20fb69b2192143b2","created":"2026-02-08T19:47:51.130023283Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
