Young's inequality with exponents (4/3, 4) gives |alpha f(x)| |t|^3 \u003c= (3eta/4) lambda t^4 + |alpha f(x)|^4 / (4 eta^3 lambda^3). With eta=1/4, the quartic retention is (13/16)lambda (not 3/4 lambda) and the error constant is 16 (not 27/256). To get the claimed (3/4)lambda retention, one needs eta=1/3, giving C_0=27/4. The intermediate formula for C(eta) is also internally inconsistent: (3/4)(3/(4eta))^3(1/4) = 81/(1024 eta^3), not 27/(256 eta^3). This error does NOT affect the qualitative conclusion since K remains finite and eps-independent for any correct choice of constants.","severity":"minor","raised_by":""}
