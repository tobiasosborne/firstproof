That is, for mu-a.e. field configuration phi, we have phi in C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3). This is established in Hairer (2014), Theorem 10.7 (regularity structures construction) and independently by Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020), Theorem 1.1 (variational construction). Both approaches construct mu as a limit of UV-regularized measures mu_eps and show the support property via Besov space embeddings and the Kolmogorov-type criterion: for phi_eps = rho_eps * phi, the moments E_mu[||phi_eps - phi_{eps'}||_{C^{-1/2-delta}}^p] are controlled uniformly, giving a.s. convergence in C^{-1/2-delta}(T^3).","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"6f255ceacc05bd3d5c61ce16b89d97b5b2cbb388aa5e87bc5809ba7f433314a6","created":"2026-02-08T19:33:31.069864202Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
