Since Z_eps is in (0, infinity) (node 1.2.3) and exp(-V_eps(phi)) \u003e 0 for mu_0-a.e. phi (node 1.2.2), the density is strictly positive mu_0-a.e. A probability measure with strictly positive density w.r.t. a reference measure is equivalent to it: for any measurable A, mu_eps(A) = integral_A Z_eps^{-1} exp(-V_eps) dmu_0 = 0 if and only if mu_0(A) = 0, since the integrand is strictly positive mu_0-a.e. Hence mu_eps ~ mu_0 for each eps \u003e 0.","inference":"assumption","workflow_state":"available","epistemic_state":"pending","taint_state":"unresolved","content_hash":"7cdebec1493f05fe403c07a14ec635c6dfeb00078753faa5fecd73a4e4c424bd","created":"2026-02-08T18:38:19.896692548Z","claimed_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}
