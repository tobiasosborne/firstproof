All concentration inequalities for mu therefore apply to functionals of the full enhanced data (phi, :phi^2:, :phi^3:).'\n\nThis is misleading and the second sentence is a non-sequitur. The Phi^4_3 measure mu is primarily constructed as a probability measure on the distribution space D'(T^3) (or C^{-1/2-delta}). The enhanced data (phi, :phi^2:, :phi^3:) provides a LIFTING of the measure to the product space X, in the sense that one can push forward mu to a measure on X by the map phi -\u003e (phi, :phi^2:_mu, :phi^3:_mu). But concentration inequalities for mu (such as sub-Gaussian tails from BG 2020) are proven for functionals of phi with respect to the Cameron-Martin structure, NOT for arbitrary functionals on X. The sentence 'All concentration inequalities for mu therefore apply to functionals of the full enhanced data' is false: a concentration inequality depends on the metric/gradient structure, and extending from functionals of phi to functionals of (phi, :phi^2:, :phi^3:) requires proof that the Wick power components inherit the concentration, which is exactly the unproven claim in node 1.6.2.7.","severity":"major","raised_by":""}
